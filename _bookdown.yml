# These two problems are what caused (some of) the appendices to appear as chapters.
# Must use tabs (not spaces!) in this file, at least when indenting "html: [ ..."
# Also, if there are no "html: [" entries, it will just build every Rmd in the directory.
# Also, # (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} header is what starts the appendix.

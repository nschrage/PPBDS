# Shopping Week {-}

<!-- To-Do: -->

<!-- 1. Put the Kant quote in a side margin and add a picture. -->

<!-- 2. Add some sidemargin notes which provide more detail during the Set Up section. Most won't care what those weird R commands are doing but, for those that do, an explanation would be polite. -->

<!-- 3. Add this video in a side margin next to "This is not the book you are looking for." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=532j-186xEQ -->

<!-- Open Questions: -->

<!-- * options(pkg="binary") needs to be set permanently. When/where do we do that? Or do we need to? Perhaps this is the first thing that we add to .Rprofile? Which week? -->


> The usual touchstone of whether what someone asserts is mere persuasion or at least a subjective conviction, i.e., firm belief, is betting. Often someone pronounces his propositions with such confident and inflexible defiance that he seems to have entirely laid aside all concern for error. A bet disconcerts him. Sometimes he reveals that he is persuaded enough for one ducat but not for ten. For he would happily bet one, but at 10 he suddenly becomes aware of what he had not previously noticed, namely that it is quite possible that he has erred. -— Immanuel Kant, *Critique of Pure Reason*

The world confronts us. Make decisions we must.


## Warning {-}

This book is not the book you are looking for.

`r knitr::include_app("https://www.youtube.com/embed/532j-186xEQ", height = "400px")`

First, the book is for students in [Gov 50: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html) and [Gov 52: Models](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html), courses offered in the Government Department at Harvard University. Everything about the book is designed to make the experience of those students better. Some of the material here may be useful to students outside of this class, but I don't really care if it is.

Second, the book changes all the time. It is as up-to-date as possible.

Third, I am highly opinionated about what matters and what does not. It is unlikely that you share my views. 

### Install R and RStudio

<!-- DK: Move all related material from Chapter 1 to here and the provide a link from there. -->

To start off, you'll need to download the necessary software:

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

2. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

R is the programming language you'll be using in this class and RStudio is the IDE you'll be using. An IDE or Integrated development environment is an app that allows you to write code.

Think of installing R like telling your computer to learn French and installing RStudio as the way you can communicate with your computer in French.

If you can't get R and R Studio working on your computer, you may use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) as a backup plan. Click on [this link]( https://rstudio.cloud/project/1486264) to go to a pre-created project which is already set up for you. You will need to sign up for a free account. You can go straight to the Tutorial section. You do not need to install anything. 

Now, let's begin with getting familiar with RStudio. Begin by opening up RStudio. You should see something like this:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/rstudio.png")`

This is your workspace! You can see three main windows right now. Let's focus on the big one on the left:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/left_window.png")`

There are three tabs in this window, we'll be focusing on the Console and Terminal. When you first start R, the Console gives you some information about your version of R. At the time when this was written, 4.0.1 was the latest version of R! The Console is where you can type and run R code. For example, if you type 1 + 1 and hit return, the Console returns 2.

Next, let's move to the top right:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/top_right_window.png")`

Here, the main two tabs you'll be using is Environment and Git (Not Pictured Yet). The Environment tab shows you the datasets and variables you currently have loaded into RStudio. In my case, I loaded in a dataset with 3407 rows and 5 columns and a variable x equal to 5. For you, the Environment should be empty, so let's change that!

To create your first variable in RStudio, go to your Console and type:

```{eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
```

Now, hit return/enter and you should see a variable x equal to 5 in your Environment! You must always hit return/enter after typing a command, otherwise RStudio will not realize that you want R to execute the command.

The bottom right window:

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/bottom_right_window.png")`

Here, the Files tab will allow you to see your computer's file system. When you create a project later, this tab will automatically show the contents in your project folder. The plots tab will show you a preview of any plots you make later on in RStudio. Packages shows all the packages you have installed in RStudio so far. Help will be [explained later](#how-to-get-help) in this chapter.

### Initial Set Up

If you are working on your own computer, copy and paste the following in to the R Console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(pkgType = "binary")
rstudioapi::writeRStudioPreference(name = "load_workspace", value = FALSE)
rstudioapi::writeRStudioPreference(name = "save_workspace", value = "never")
```

*Do not run these functions if you are working on RStudio Cloud.*

The first causes R to download binary (i.e., pre-built) packages by default. Without this option set to "binary," you will occasionally be asked by R:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
Do you want to install from sources the packages which 
need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

Unless you have a good reason not to, always answer "no" to this question. 

The `rstudioapi` commands set sensible defaults for working with RStudio. 


### Package Installation

<!-- Figure out if we need this. Does remotes come pre-installed? If it does, do you need to library it or can you just get away with calling it? We are only using the dev version of learnr because we think we need it for a feature which allows (I think!) results of code evaluation to persist across questions. Do we really need it? Has it been incorporated in the released version? -->

Copy and paste the following to the R Console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("rstudio/learnr")
remotes::install_github("davidkane9/PPBDS.data")
```

R packages generally live in one of two places: CRAN (rhymes with "clan") for more mature, popular packages and Github for more experimental, less stable packages. `install.packages()` gets packages from CRAN.

If you are on RStudio Cloud, you can now complete the first tutorial, but remember two things. First, your interim work is not saved when you do a tutorial RStudio Cloud. So, although it is fine to do Tutorial 0 there, you should not use it for later tutorials. Second, you will almost certainly need to get R and RStudio set up on your computer. Start now!


### Tutorials

For each chapter of the textbook, there is a corresponding tutorial available in the **PPBDS.data** package. In order to access these tutorials, follow these steps:

1. Run `library(PPBDS.data)` in the R Console.

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/run_ppbds.png")`

2. You can access the tutorials via the Tutorial pane in the top right tab in RStudio. Click "Start tutorial".

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/tutorial_pane.gif")`

In order to expand the window, you can drag and enlarge the tutorial pane inside RStudio. In order to open a popup window, click the "Show in New Window" icon next to the home icon.

You may notice that the Jobs tab will create output as the tutorial is starting up. This is because RStudio is running the code to create the tutorial. If you accidentally clicked "Start Tutorial" and would like to stop the job from running, you can click the back arrow in the Jobs tab, and then press the red stop sign icon.

3. Your work will be saved between sessions, so you can complete the tutorial in multiple sittings. In order to complete the tutorial successfully, make sure you enter your name at the very beginning and answer all questions. Once you have completed the tutorial, follow the instructions on the tutorial `Submit` page and upload the resulting `responses.rds` file to Canvas.

`r include_graphics("00-shopping-week/images/tutorial_popup.gif")`

You've finished a tutorial! Now what? There are a few ways you can close out of a tutorial safely so you can quit your RStudio session.

* If you clicked "Show in new window" and were working on the tutorial in a pop-up window, simply X out of the pop-up window
* If you were working on the tutorial inside the Tutorial pane of RStudio, simply press the red stop sign icon

<!-- Maybe start with 5 adult brothers. You have been given 4 heights. What is the 5th? Preceptor Table. Where the 4 chosen at random? Second problem: 7000 Harvard students. We have 100 measures of height. What is the average height? What is the 90th percentile height? Much harder. Third problem, we have some X variables for all students. What if we have age and gender for everyone? -->

<!-- But none of that is causal! It is only predictive.  -->

<!-- 1) Two sources of difficulty. First, some rows have only one column. This is really confusing. What is the meaning of average causal effect in that world? Can't talk about average causal effect for whole population. Need a Preceptor Table with fewer rows. Can only estimate the average causal effect for the population of people who are allowed to be governor. How do we estimate it? Related issue is: What causal effect do we really care about? "What is the causal effect on the treated?" -->

<!-- Example: Does Enos allow us to calculate a causal effect for people who commute by cars? Can we calculate the causal effect for people in New York City? Barcelona? Representativeness --- add a paragrpah about this. Do the experimental estimates apply outside the experiment. -->

<!-- Second, what about assignment that isn't completely random? Maybe sort of random. Maybe we pretend that its random. How misleading is that assumption? "Regression discontinuity design". "Difference in difference design". a "natural experiment". Connect all this to the central theme of 98% of social science research --- using observational data to infer causation by treating the assignment mechanism as being close enough to random. This is where we can discuss stuff like natural experiments, difference in differences, regression discontinuity and so on. Let's discuss. (Save this for next week.)  -->


<!-- 2) Most things in life are somewhere between the one column and the two column case. To show this, we need a new Preceptor Table in which, instead of rows in which Y always have two columns, we have a Y which mostly has two columns but sometimes only has 1. What's nice about this example is that it generalizes to other cases. -->

<!-- ignorability as a concept -->

<!-- Another aspect of the Governor's paper that I like is that it highlights that, often, we can only (plausibly) estimate tau for a subset of the data.  -->

<!-- 3) let's do some coding! (Or maybe we don't show the students the code you use to demonstrate these things. I am not sure.) Anyway, start with a simple example (maybe 8 people) in which you know all the values in the RT and in which tau is a constant positive number. (Recall some of the videos about permtutations tests that I made you watch.) Question: Does random assignment guarantee that we get the right answer? NO! This is a point that students often get wrong. Pick one "random" assignment which generates a negative estimate of tau. And that could easily happen. -->

<!-- But then show what happens for all the 70 (8 choose 4) possible treatment assignments, each one with equal likelihood of happening if assignment is truly random. (Subtle note is that we are requiring that 4 get the treatment and 4 get the control.) Some of these overestimate tau. Some underestimate it. But the average of all possible assignments will be tau, which is why randomization is so cool. But the 70 possible results are really spread out! It would not be surprising if, by chance, you picked one that gave a very wrong answer. Which would make you sad! -->

<!-- Then, extend this example to 1000 units. There are 2.702882e+299 possible assignments of 500 to treatment and 500 to control. You can't calculate the (estimated) treatment effect with all of them. But you can sample 1,000 of them. Two things will be true. Average of this sample will be the (true) treatment, just as with the 8 unit case. And it will be much more precisely estimated. Overlap the density estimates. Both will be centered around tau, the value of which you know. Butthe second is much more peaked.  -->

<!-- Fourth, the above provides a natural segue into permutation tests, which are just like these experiments, except you assume tau = 0. That is what a permutation test is.  -->

<!-- Permutation example and code. Biggest current hole is the lack of a permutation test coding example. When we do this, we will want to create the permutations "by hand," rather than relying on an R package for doing so, I think that there are some elegant ways to do this with tidyverse, like crossing() or expand(). Maybe rsample::bootstraps()?  -->

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="[Don Rubin was a professor of Statistics at  Harvard.](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/bagss/Bilder/Editorial/21711197.jpg).", fig.margin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("03-rubin-causal-model/images/don_rubin.jpg")
```

The Rubin Causal Model (RCM) is an approach to the statistical analysis of cause and effect based on the framework of potential outcomes, created by Donald Rubin. The name "Rubin Causal Model" was first coined in Holland (1986). 

## What is a causal effect?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This study was conducted by Ryan Enos.", fig.margin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("03-rubin-causal-model/images/enos_seal.png")
```

The Rubin Causal Model (RCM) is based on the idea of **potential outcomes.** For example, let's use a social experiment that looked at exclusionary attitudes of commuters on a train platform. The commuters were exposed to one of two possible conditions, and then their attitudes towards immigrants were measured. One condition was being on a train platform near individuals speaking Spanish. The other was being on a train platform with no one in the vicinity. To calculate the causal effect of having Spanish speakers nearby, we need to compare the outcome for an individual in one alternative future (with Spanish speakers) to another (without Spanish speakers). Since it is impossible to observe both potential outcomes at once, one of the potential outcomes is always missing. This dilemma is the *Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference*. (If you are confused on why it is impossible to observe both potential outcomes, reference section 3.5.2 under 'Other issues with causal inference'.)

In most circumstances, we are interested in comparing two futures, one generally termed "treatment" and the other "control." These labels are somewhat arbitrary. The difference between the potential outcome under treatment and the potential outcome under control is called a "causal effect" or a "treatment effect."  The scenario that didn't actually happen, and thus that we didn't observe, is called a "counterfactual." 

Thus, according to the RCM, the **causal effect** of being on the platform with Spanish speakers is the *difference* between what your attitude would have been under "treatment" (with Spanish speakers) and "control" (no Spanish speakers).

Low numbers indicate liberal attitudes towards immigrants and high numbers indicate more conservative attitudes. If your attitude towards immigrants would have been a 13 with Spanish speakers and a 9 without Spanish speakers, then the causal effect of being on a platform with Spanish speakers is a 4-point increase in your attitude.

We will use the variable $Y$ to represent values we are interested in understanding (potential outcomes). $Y$ is called the *response variable* because it is the variable we want to explain in the context of an experiment. In our case this would be the attitude score. If we are trying to understand a causal effect however, we need two variables to work with: something that represents control and treated values separately. In order to do that, we will use the variables $Y_t$ and $Y_c$. That gives us two response variables to work with that vary on their treatment status.

### Potential outcomes: introduction to the Preceptor Table

Let's start by defining what a Preceptor table is. A **Preceptor Table** is a table with rows and columns for all the data that we would (reasonably) like to have. Preceptor tables can vary depending on the number of rows and columns they have, as well as the amount of data that is missing from them. We use question marks as placeholders for the data we are missing in the Preceptor tables. 

<!-- SJ: the mention of being omniscient here is a bit confusing, it is just mentioned that if you're omniscient then you would be able to know both outcomes which is kind of a "no duh" statement, but what is the reason for saying that? Were you trying to tell us why we have to find the outcomes for each individual scenario (control and treatment) because we do not have omniscient knowledge? -->

Now, suppose that Yao is one of the commuters surveyed in this social experiment. If we were omniscient, we would know the outcomes for Yao under both treatment (with Spanish speakers) and control (no Spanish speakers). The causal effect, or treatment effect, is the difference between these two potential outcomes. We can present this with the following table of potential outcomes, which we will call an Ideal Preceptor Table. This Preceptor Table is considered *ideal* because we are not missing any data, and we can reasonably understand what all the numbers in it mean.


`r margin_note("We are using the phrase 'Attitude if' in this Ideal Preceptor Table because of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. We cannot know both of Yao's potential outcomes. Instead by pretending we are omniscient, we can fill in the values that normally would be impossible to find. In that case, we have both of Yao's potential outcomes without him being assigned to either the Control or Treatment group. We *just know* his attitude in both situations, and are using this to clarify what an Ideal Preceptor Table would look like, even if this is generally impossible to have.")`

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'left'}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = "Yao",
       ytreat = "13",
       ycontrol = "9",
       ydiff = "+4") %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Subject**"),
                ytreat = "Attitude if Treated",
                ycontrol = "Attitude if Control",
                ydiff = "Treatment Effect") %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

From this table we only know the causal effect on Yao. Everyone else in the study might have their attitude score go down if treated (more liberal). However, regardless of what the causal effect is for the other subjects, the causal effect for Yao is a shift towards a more conservative attitude relative to what his attitude would have been had Spanish speakers *not* been on his platform.

In a Preceptor Table, mathematical notation can also be used to describe potential outcomes.

`r margin_note("$Y_{t}$ is the same as 'Attitude if Treated'")`
$Y_{t}$ is Yao's attitude toward immigrants if there are Spanish speakers on his platform (treated). In general, this notation expresses the potential outcome which results from a treatment, $t$, on a unit, $u$.

`r margin_note("$Y_{c}$ is the same as 'Attitude if Control'")`
Similarly, $Y_{c}$ is the effect of a different treatment, $c$ or control, on a unit, $u$. In this case, $Y_{c}$ is Yao's attitude if there were no Spanish speakers on his platform.

`r margin_note("$Y_{t}-Y_{c}$ is the same as 'Treatment Effect'")`
$Y_{t}-Y_{c}$ is the causal effect pf there being Spanish speakers on the platform.  Thus, Yao would have an attitude score of $13$ if there were Spanish speakers and $9$ if there were not; the causal effect of the presence of Spanish speakers is is $4$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = "Yao",
       ytreat = "13",
       ycontrol = "9",
       ydiff = "+4") %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t - Y_c$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

### Estimands

In order to get an idea of an Estimand, let's look again at our Ideal Preceptor Table for Yao:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = "Yao",
       ytreat = "13",
       ycontrol = "9",
       ydiff = "+4") %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t - Y_c$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject)))%>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

We have Yao's potential outcome under treatment, Yao's potential outcome under control, and the difference between the two. The difference is generally called the "causal effect" or "treatment effect."  But it is in fact only one possible causal variable we might be interested in. We could also calculate the ratio of potential outcomes for Yao:

<!-- SJ: It takes a pretty long time to get to the point in the chapter where Estimad is actually explained/mentioned. As a student learning this for the first time I was looking for a mention of it much sooner, but that could just be my preference. Like for instance at least tell us why we are seeing this tibble (Rubin Table) by saying before "In order to get an idea of an Estimad let's look again at our basic Rubin Table for Joe:" -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = "Yao",
       ytreat = "13",
       ycontrol = "9",
       yratio = "13/9") %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c$$"),
                yratio = md("$$Y_t / Y_c$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject)))%>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Or the percentage change in his potential outcomes:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = "Yao",
       ytreat = "13",
       ycontrol = "9",
       yperc = "+44.4%") %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c$$"),
                yperc = md("$$(Y_t - Y_c / Y_c) \\times 100$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

So far, we have considered a table showing potential outcomes for only Yao. Generally a study would not have just one subject. Instead there would be many individuals in an experiment that would all have their own unique potential outcomes. In that case, it no longer makes sense to have $Y_t$ or $Y_c$ represent all of the unique potential outcomes in a table. A new variable is needed to differentiate between individuals. 

In other words, there needs to be a distinction between $Y_t$ for Yao, and $Y_t$ for Emma. We could do something like $Y_t(Yao)$ and $Y_t(Emma)$, but that would be an ineffective approach if we wanted to fill out a full Preceptor Table. Instead, we use the variable $u$ ($u$ for units) to indicate that the treatment effect varies by each individual unit (person) in our study. The $u$ represents all the different individuals in a study without requiring that we create a new variable for each person. Now, instead of $Y_t$, we use $Y_t(u)$ to represent Attitude if Treated. If you want to talk about only Emma, you could say "Emma's Attitude if Treated" or "$Y_t(Emma)$" or "the $Y_t(u)$ for Emma", but not just $Y_t$. That notation is too ambiguous when there is more than one subject you might be talking about.

Now, let's consider a larger sample of subjects using our new notation: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "11", "9", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("9", "11", "10", "12", "4"),
       ydiff = c("+4", "0", "+1", "-3", "+1")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

From this Ideal Preceptor Table, there are many possible values we might calculate.  Here are just a sampling:

<!-- DK: Need to discuss other estimands, like causal effect on the treated. -->

::: {.fullwidth} 

- A potential outcome for one person, e.g., Yao's potential outcome under treatment ($13$).  
- A causal effect for one person, such as for Emma.  This is the difference between the potential outcomes, which we have provided as its own column ($11 - 11 = 0$).
- The most positive causal effect.  Here, that is $+4$, from Yao ($13 - 9 = +4$).
- The most negative causal effect.  Here, that is $-3$, from Tahmid ($9 - 12 = -3$).
- The median causal effect ($+1$).
- The median percentage change.  To do this, calculate the percentage change for each person.  You'll get 5 percentages: $+44.4\%$, $0.0\%$, $+10.0\%$, $-25.0\%$, and $+25.0\%$.  The median is $+10.0\%$.
- The total number of people for whom the causal effect is positive: $3$.
- And so on. There are a lot of things one might care about!

:::

<!-- AR: the ATE is just another estimand--and a particularly important one--so
I think it should be mentioned here.  We can talk about calculating it from
actual data later. Calling this the "average treatment effect" rather than "average causal
effect" throughout -->

One very common value we might care about has its own name, the **average treatment effect**.  The average treatment effect (often abbreviated **ATE**) is the mean of all the causal effects.  Here, the mean is $+0.6$.

`r margin_note("An estimand is not the number value calculated, but rather the variable you want to understand from your data.")`
So far, we have been able to calculate all of these different values through simple arithmetic. But remember that in a Actual Preceptor Table we will have a bunch of missing data! This will require us to estimate.  An **estimand** is some variable in the real world that we are trying to measure. All of the variables we calculated above are examples of estimands we might be interested in. For example, we might be interested in the average treatment effect of the train experiment. The estimand in that case would be the ATE. 

An Actual Preceptor Table has question marks that represent all the data we are missing because we are not omniscient in the real world. So, an Actual Preceptor Table with our data would look something like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Again, question marks are responses that could not be observed. The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference^[Holland 1986.] is that directly observing unit-level causal effects is impossible. If we don't have all the values in our table, how do we calculate anything?

> "We should start the inferential process with clear statements of scientific objectives and associated estimands, and a precise description of the hypothetical data set from which we would simply calculate the estimands. Such a data set could be composed mostly of unobserved or even unobservable values, but it defines the objects of inference." ^[Rubin 2011]
`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Don Rubin')`

## How do we fill in the missing values?

How can we fill in the question marks?  Because of the fundamental problem of causal inference, we can never *know* the missing values. Because we can never know the missing values, we must make assumptions. "Assumption" just means that we need a "model," and all models have parameters.

### Constant Treatment Effect

One model might be that the causal effect is the same for everyone. There is a single parameter, $\tau$, which we then estimate. Once we have an estimate, we can fill in the Preceptor Table because, knowing it, we know what the unseen potential outcome is for each person. Now our estimand is $\tau$; whether this is a sensible estimand depends on how close the real world conforms to our assumption that the causal effect is the same for everyone.

Remember what our Preceptor Table looks like with all of the missing data: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```


If we assume $\tau$ is the treatment effect for everyone, how do we fill in the table? We are using $\tau$ as an estimate for causal effect. It therefore has to be true that $Y_t(u) - Y_c(u) = \tau$ if $\tau$ is our estimate of the constant treatment effect. Using simple algebra, it is then clear that $Y_t(u) = Y_c(u) + \tau$ and $Y_c(u) = Y_t(u) - \tau$. In other words, you could add it to the observed value of every observation in the control group (or subtract it from the observed value of every observation in the treatment group), and thus fill in all the missing values.


Assuming there is a constant treatment effect, $\tau$, for everyone filling in the missing values would look like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "$$10 + \\tau$$", "$$12 + \\tau$$", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("$$13 - \\tau$$", "$$11 - \\tau$$", "10", "12", "$$5 - \\tau$$"),
       ydiff = c("$$\\tau$$", "$$\\tau$$", "$$\\tau$$", "$$\\tau$$", "$$\\tau$$")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Now we need to find an estimate for $\tau$ in order to fill in our table with numbers that we can begin to understand. Again, we are assuming $Y_t(u) - Y_c(u) = \tau$. 

That equation outlines a clear way in which we can estimate $\tau$. We can subtract the average of the observed control values from the observed treated values. $$((13 + 11 + 5) / 3) - ((10 + 12) /  2)$$ $$9.67 - 11 = -1.33$$
This gives us an estimate of $-1.33$ for $\tau$. Let's fill in our missing values is by adding $\tau$ to the observed value under control (for units in the control group) or by subtracting $\tau$ from the observed value under treatment (for units in the treatment group), like so:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

<!-- DK: Is this too subtle a point to make here? First, "filling in the same causal effect" is somewhat sloppy. You mean, "assuming the causal effect is identical for everyone". Second, it is unclear (to me) what the relationship is between the estimand I care about and the model that I am using. (There might be such a relationship, but it is too tricky to be discussed here.) In general, we just pick whatever model we think best captures the underlying reality, or at least as much of that reality as we have the data to deal with. So, in this case, we assume that tau is constant. That is not unreasonable! Then, we can fill in the Preceptor Table. Then, with the complete RT, we can calculate any estimand we want. -->

### Constant by Two Parameters

A second model might be that the causal effect is constant within some other categories, and not across the entire sample. Maybe one of those categories is sex? Perhaps it is $\tau_1$ for females and $\tau_2$ for males. We are making this assumption to give us a different model with which to fill in the missing values in our table. The key concept is that we can't make any progress unless we make some assumptions. That is an inescapable result of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. So we make some assumptions, which gives us some models.

Let's look at this particular model in which we think sex has an impact on treatment effect:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "$$10 + \\tau_F$$", "$$12 + \\tau_M$$", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("$$13 - \\tau_M$$", "$$11 - \\tau_F$$", "10", "12", "$$5 - \\tau_M$$"),
       ydiff = c("$$\\tau_M$$", "$$\\tau_F$$", "$$\\tau_F$$", "$$\\tau_M$$", "$$\\tau_M$$")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

`r margin_note("'Actual ATE' refers to the average treatment effect we would calculate if we knew all potential outcomes. This is of course not possible due to the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference, however we will pretend we know in order to highlight potential problems with estimating ATE.")`

<!-- SJ: In need of a concrete definition of "Fundamental Problem of Casual Inference", I know you have described it above but maybe make it more clear explain it more and put it in bold or something? The reader should have no doubt in their mind that they read about it before when you mention it now -->

In this example, there is indeed a single causal effect for everyone: $+2$.  Note that the *observed* values are all the same, but the unobserved values were such that our estimated ATE, $-1.33$, is pretty far from the actual ATE, $+2$.

We would have two different estimates for $\tau$.

$\tau_M$ would be $$(13+5)/2 - 12 = -3$$
$\tau_F$ would be $$(11-10 = +1)$$ 
Using those values, we would fill out our new table like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "$$10 + (+1)$$", "$$12 + (-3)$$", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("$$13 - (-3)$$", "$$11 - (+1)$$", "10", "12", "$$5 - (-3)$$"),
       ydiff = c("-3", "+1", "+1", "-3", "-3")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Which gives us:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "11", "9", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("16", "10", "10", "12", "8"),
       ydiff = c("-3", "+1", "+1", "-3", "-3")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

We now have two different estimates for Emma. When we estimate her Attitude if Control using an assumption of constant treatment effect, we estimate $Y_c(Emma)$ to be 12.33. When we estimate assuming treatment effect is constant across sexes, we get $Y_c(Emma)$ to be 10. This difference between our estimates for Emma is the heart of inference. 

<!-- I am confused now because thinking about no causation without manipulation. Is it possible to say that gender does not "cause" the effect, but rather treatment effect just varies by gender? Or no? -->

<!-- SJ: It might be helpful to explain what the assumption is that is being made in the "$\tau \times age$" model, it may seem obvious to you writing it but it is helpful for the reader to get a nice solid example of what the assumption is, what it looks like, and why it's important  -->

 <!-- Don't know exactly what to do with this: A third model might be that the causal effect is a number $\tau$ multiplied by age: $\tau \times age$.-->
 
<!-- EC: One more sentence here about how randomized assignments could be extrapolated to reflect the population would be great -->

### Average treatment effect

The average treatment effect is the average difference in *potential* outcomes between the treated group and the control group. Note that this is the exact  process we used to find an estimate for $\tau$ when we wanted to assume there was a constant treatment effect for everyone in the study.

As we did before, the simplest way to estimate the ATE is to take the mean of the treated group ($9.67$) and the mean of the control group ($11.0$) and then take the difference in those means ($-1.33$). We'll call this estimate of the ATE $\widehat{ATE}$, pronounced "ATE-hat."

If we already did this exact same calculation above, why are we talking about it again? 

Let's take a step back and say we can't assume across genders for estimates of $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$. Say we also can't assume that treatment effect is constant for everyone. Those are the two ways we have learned so far to be able to fill in  missing values, so what are we supposed to do now that we can't make either of those assumptions? This is where $\widehat{ATE}$ is helpful. 

Note that *some* estimands may not require filling in all the question marks in the Preceptor Table. For example, we'll see that with randomized assignment to treatment, we can get a good estimate of the *average* treatment effect even without filling in every question mark---the average treatment effect is just a single number. Rarely in a study do we care about what happens to individuals. In our case, we don't care about what specifically would happen to Cassidy's attitude, instead we care more generally about how our experiment impacts people's attitudes towards immigrants. This is why an average estimate, like $\widehat{ATE}$ can be helpful.

As we noted before, this is a popular estimand.  Why?

1. There's an obvious *estimator* for this estimand: the difference in *observed* outcomes between the treated group and the control group. ($Y_t(u) = Y_c(u)$)
2. If treatment is *randomly assigned*, the estimator is *unbiased*: you can be pretty confident in the estimate if you have a large enough treatment and control group.
3. As we did earlier, if you are willing to assume that the causal effect is the same for everyone (a big assumption!), you can use your estimate of the ATE to fill in the missing individual values in your Preceptor Table.

Just because the ATE is often a useful estimand doesn't mean that it *always* is. 

Consider point #3. For example, let's say the treatment effect varies dependent on party. For Democrats there is a strong negative effect, but for Republicans there is a small positive effect.  However, the average treatment effect for the whole sample, even if you estimate it correctly, will be a single negative number (since the negative effect for Democrats is larger than the positive effect for Republicans).  So while our model to estimate the ATE is simple and thus alluring---with randomized treatment assignment, a difference in means will do the trick---don't assume that it's always the right model for your problem.


So estimating the ATE is easy ($Y_c(u) = Y_t(u)$).  But is our $\widehat{ATE}$ a good estimate of the actual ATE?  After all, if we knew all the missing values in the Preceptor Table, we could calculate the ATE perfectly.  But those missing values may be wildly different from the observed values.  Consider this unobservable true Preceptor Table:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "12", "14", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("11", "9", "10", "12", "3"),
       ydiff = c("+2", "+2", "+2", "+2", "+2")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

`r margin_note("'Actual ATE' refers to the average treatment effect we would calculate if we knew all potential outcomes. This is of course not possible due to the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference, however we will pretend we know in order to highlight potential problems with estimating ATE.")`

In this example, there is indeed a constant treatment effect for everyone: $+2$. Note that the *observed* values are all the same, but the unobserved values were such that our estimated ATE, $-1.33$, is pretty far from the actual ATE, $+2$. We'll consider in a little bit when it is reasonable to assume that our estimate of the ATE is a good one. (The best way, as we'll see, is randomized assignment to treatment.) If we think we have a reasonable estimate of ATE, using that value as a constant for $\tau$ might be our *best guess* if we do want to estimate an unobserved potential outcome for an individual. 

### Heterogenous Treatment Effects

As we discussed, $\widehat{ATE}$ can be a useful estimand in telling us generally about the treatment effect. This sort of generalized estimand may not always be what we are interested in. In the train study, all of the individuals surveyed are different in many different ways, for example gender, income, and age. Therefore, our study population is heterogeneous, because all of the subjects are not the same. When we estimate ATE, we are making assumptions that there is a similar treatment effect for all subjects in the study despite the heterogeneity of our sample. 

There will inevitably be some random variation of treatment effect for individuals in a study. The effect on an individual, like Yao, may be different than the treatment effect on another individual that is seemingly very similar to Yao. This is one example of a *heterogeneous treatment effect*. 

Another example of a *heterogeneous treatment effect* is when the variation in individual treatments are non-random and correlated with some or multiple factors. For example, maybe we think that the treatment effect varies depending on the sex and age of an individual. In this case, sex, age and treatment status are three characteristics by which treatment effect varies. The different variables are not necessarily completely independent of each other. Instead, some combination of these variables might interact. We call this an interaction effect, and it can have an impact on our estimates of treatment effect.

So, a heterogeneous treatment effect can both explain individual variation, as well as variation between groups determined by some other variable(s). We will learn to deal with heterogeneous treatment effects in later chapters, however it is worth keeping in mind how assumptions of homogeneity can impact our understanding of treatment effect.

<!-- We may not just be interested in the effect on Yao, a person in our sample, but on Eliot, for whom we observe neither potential outcome.  Even if we have a good estimate of the ATE for *this sample*, it may be a bad estimate of the ATE for the *population* if not all people have the same chance of being included in our sample.  So reducing our uncertainty about Yao may still not answer the question we really care about. There is still a lot of missing data. -->

## Missing data

### Everything is a missing data problem

It's worth discussing in general the problem of **missing data**.  Why is that? Not being able to observe multiple counterfactuals is just one example of missing data. There are in fact many other potential sources of missing data. This missing data problem is what creates the need for statistical inferences. If the data were not missing, inference would not be needed.

Let's explore another common source of missing data. For example, say that before you run the train experiment, you want to know the average attitude towards immigrants of *all* United States adults. At first, this seems like an easy problem---there's nothing causal here!  If you knew the true values, you could build a dataset like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "...", "Person N"),
       `Attitude` = c("13", "11", "9", "...", "10")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Person**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

Then, your answer is simply the average of all the values. 

But do we have this table?  No!  What we actually have is this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "...", "Person N"),
       `Attitude` = c("?", "?", "?", "...", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Person**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

In reality, we don't know the attitude towards immigrants of any United States adults. That is, we have a lot of *missing data*.

But maybe we could survey 1,000 people on their attitudes towards immigrants, and get a table that looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Respondent 1", "Respondent 2", "Respondent 3", "...", "Respondent 1,000"),
       `Attitude` = c("13", "9", "11", "...", "10")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Respondent**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

By surveying 1,000 people on their attitudes towards immigrants we now have some values to work with. This, however, does not solve the missing data problem. We are likely interested in the causal effect *in general*, not just for our 1,000 person sample. We'll need to think about whether our *sample* is representative of the full population. For the vast majority of US adults we still have no value. This is the second of the two most common sources of missing data: 

<!-- SJ: Confused here, I thought you just said in line chunk 447 that this data doesn't have a causal effect because it is the average US citizen's attitude towards immigrants in general but now it is saying that there is a causal effect that we are likely interested in -->

1. For the units in our sample, we only see *one* potential outcome
2. For the units outside our sample, we see *no* potential outcomes

<!-- SJ: what is the purpose of having these two bullet points here about how we see only one potential outcome versus none? It seems a little redundant if all it is meant to explain is that we don't know the data for people we haven't surveyed, maybe a little more explanation is needed here to justify what you are explaining or the point you are making. I am assuming (no pun intended) it is because there is no way to make assumptions here?  -->

### The Infinite Preceptor Table: many kinds of missing data

We have spoken about Ideal Preceptor Tables (no missing data), Actual Preceptor Tables (question marks representing the values we don't know), but there is one more type of Preceptor Table. In the real world, a Preceptor Table has an infinite number of rows, and therefore an infinite amount of missing data. We call this type of Preceptor Table an Infinite Preceptor Table. Such a reality is unworkable, so we make assumptions to reduce the true problem to something more manageable.

`r margin_note("Why should we care about Yao's (or anyone's) attitude years from now? We need to consider why we are doing the experiment in the first place. Why would we care about Yao's attitude towards immigrants in the first place? There might be many answers to this question, like wanting to understand how he might vote or treat other people. That would mean we care about Yao's attitude in the future, not just at the time of being surveyed.")`
Let's start by looking at what kinds of missing data make up the Infinite Preceptor Table. For example, say we only care about the causal effect of this experiment on Yao. Do we only care about his attitude right after the experiment? No! We also care about Yao's potential outcomes one year from now, two years from now, and so on.

So our full Preceptor Table includes people we know (Yao) and people we don't (for example, Eliot), both now and in the future:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao this year", "Yao next year", "Yao two years from now", "Eliot this year", "Eliot next year", "Eliot two years from now", "...", "Person n at time t"),
       ytreat = c("13", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

In fact, because time is continuous, there is a row for Yao now, Yao one second from now, Yao one day from now and so on. The Preceptor Table extends downward forever. Thus, in order to estimate any causal effect, we need *assumptions*, so we aren't dealing with an infinite table. 

The most obvious way to eliminate some rows from the table is to assume the causal effect for Yao now is the same as all the ones for Yao in the future. Is that plausible? Sort of. Yao now and Yao in one second are pretty similar! Yao now and Yao in 30 years are less so.  Unfortunately, there's no magic way to get a good estimate of every missing value in the infinite Preceptor Table! But through some assumptions, we can reduce the true problem to the problem we were dealing with before. 

<!--SJ: Maybe a visual representation of what you are trying to say here? It could be helpful to show how the values might not change for Yao in one second but maybe they would a year from now and two years from now etc. and maybe sauce in a plausible reason as to why? ie: Yao lost his job and his political preferences are shifting -->

Not only can we extend the Preceptor Table by adding people not in our sample to the rows, but we can also add additional treatments to the columns.  Let's go back to the original five people in our sample. What if we also wanted to test the causal effect of another language being spoken on the platform?  We'll call the original treatment $t$ and the new treatment $t'$.


<!-- SJ: Maybe add a sentence quickly re explaining what was going on in the train sample with the five people, you made a pretty quick shift in topics and right now the readers head is all wrapped up in focusing on Yao and time being continuous and Yao one second from now versus 30 years from now. Like possibly clarifying that new treatment is the new language being spoken on the train would be helpful as well. -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ytreat2 = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
             ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
             ytreat2 = md("$$Y_{t'}(u)$$"),
             ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Note that for Yao, we now have three causal effects we can estimate: the difference between the original treatment and the new treatment, the difference between the original treatment and control, and the difference between the new treatment and control.  And that's just when looking at differences!  Recall there are many other potential estimands we could be interested in, such as ratios, percent changes, and so on.

Even if you have just one language you are testing, there still could be multiple treatments.  For example, the duration the commuter is on the platform with the Spanish speakers:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ytreat2 = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ytreat3 = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ytreat4 = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ytreat5 = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
             ytreat = md("$$Y_{\\text{1 minute}}(u)$$"),
             ytreat2 = md("$$Y_{\\text{5 minutes}}(u)$$"),
             ytreat3 = md("$$Y_{\\text{10 minutes}}(u)$$"),
             ytreat4 = md("$$Y_{\\text{15 minutes}}(u)$$"),
             ytreat5 = md("$$Y_{\\text{20 minutes}}(u)$$"),
             ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Again, there are many possible estimands.  It's worth noting when the treatments have some numeric relationship to each other (in this case time), though, there may be reasonable assumptions we can use to help fill in the missing values -- but we aren't there yet!

Instead of considering the treatment in terms of duration, we could also consider different volume levels at which Spanish is being spoken. We might assume that the volume at which the Spanish is being spoken on the train platform could influence potential outcomes, so we are interested in it for that reason:


Instead of considering the treatment in terms of duration, we could also consider different volume levels at which Spanish is being spoken:


<!-- SJ: It could be helpful to add a note saying, "In other words, the louder/quieter the Spanish is being spoken on the train likely influences the outcome." This may seem obvious but it is just very helpful to be constantly reminded the larger picture of the choices we make as data scienists and resons for creating tibbles with different treatments  -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ytreat1001 = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ytreat1002 = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       yellipsis = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
             ytreat = md("$$Y_{\\text{Volume 1}}(u)$$"),
             ytreat1001 = md("$$Y_{\\text{Volume 2}}(u)$$"),
             ytreat1002 = md("$$Y_{\\text{Volume 3}}(u)$$"),
             yellipsis = md("$$Y_{\\text{Volume N}}(u)$$"),
             ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Indeed, there are an infinite number of possible treatments. The Preceptor Table extends to the right forever. Again, assumptions come to our rescue. Or rather, we just throw up our hands and only try to estimate a few things. This is why it is crucial to define one's estimand precisely: if we are interested in the difference in potential outcomes between Spanish being spoken for 10 minutes at a volume level 3 versus control, we can ignore all the other possible columns in the infinite Preceptor Table.

`r margin_note("A true Preceptor Table has an infinite number of rows and columns. Assumptions are what reduce the true problem to a workable problem.")`

Thus, whenever you are considering a causal question, the best way to think about it is to start with the infinite Preceptor Table.  First we throw out the rows we think are duplicates (such as all the observations for Yao one second from now, two seconds from now, etc.) or that are outside the scope of what we are interested in for now (maybe we don't care about outcomes 30 years in the future for this study).  Second, we throw out the columns that we don't care about, which are all the possible treatments we aren't considering.  Finally, we define precisely---in terms of potential outcomes---our estimand.  It may be something simple, such as the average treatment effect, or something more complex.  Once we have done these steps, we can start thinking about how to fill in the question marks.  But remember that the infinite Preceptor Table is always there, and you should be conscious of which rows and columns you are throwing out!

## Uncertainty and Confounding

### Uncertainty

Let's return to our sample of five people, and an assumption that there is a constant treatment effect of -1.33 for all of them. Recall our Preceptor Table that looked like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "8.67", "10.67", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("14.33", "12.33", "10", "12", "6.33"),
       ydiff = c("-1.33", "-1.33", "-1.33", "-1.33", "-1.33")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

In general, do we think that if Yao wasn't on the platform with Spanish speakers, his attitude toward immigrants would be exactly $14.33$? Of course not! We have some uncertainty around these numbers.  There are two main sources of uncertainty we have to take into account when making a prediction for Yao: 

1. `r newthought("Uncertainty in estimating the ATE.")` Even if treatment is randomly assigned, and thus $\widehat{ATE}$ is an unbiased estimate of ATE, we still may not have a very precise estimate if our sample is small. With this miniscule sample (five subjects!), the uncertainty might be gigantic, perhaps something like $(-3, 2)$, which would lead to a prediction for Yao of $(10, 15)$. As we get a larger sample size, this uncertainty decreases.  -->

2. `r newthought("Individual Variation.")` Even if we have a perfect estimate of the *average* treatment effect, it still may be the case that the effect *for Yao* is higher or lower than the average. We can assume this away if we say that the treatment effect is a constant $τ$ for everyone, but that is not likely to be true in the real world -- and this source of uncertainty does not go away simply by collecting more observations. So with a large sample, let's say that we calculated a confidence interval around $\widehat{ATE}$ of $(-1.66, -1)$, leading to an interval for Yao's outcome under control of $(14.66, 14)$. The uncertainty due to individual variation may still be a great deal greater -- say $(13, 15)$. These numbers are simply illustrative, but they highlight an important point: even if you have a good estimate of the ATE, you should still be much more uncertain about the causal effect for any *particular individual*. 


The main takeaway is that we can get rid of #1 by collecting more data, but the only way to get rid of #2 is through making assumptions, potentially very strong ones. Later in the book we will look at ways to estimate parameter uncertainty more closely, but for now it is worth keeping different sources of uncertainty in mind. 

### The assignment mechanism

Remember that *everything is a missing data problem*.   We sidestepped the following question before: Is the difference in sample means between treated units and control units, $\widehat{ATE}$, a good estimate of the ATE?  That depends entirely on the method by which units are assigned treatment, which is called the **assignment mechanism**.  That is the mechanism whereby some values are missing and some values are observed.

As we discussed earlier, this already comes up in non-causal context when considering *sampling*.  If we are trying to estimate the average attitude towards immigrants in the U.S., we usually do so by taking a sample.  If the process by which people enter our sample is related to their attitude, even indirectly, then estimates from our sample won't be good estimates for the population.  We called this the *sampling mechanism*.

The sampling mechanism still matters in causal inference.  You may want to estimate the causal effect for Eliot, for example, rather than Yao.  But before you even get to the sampling mechanism, there is another missing data problem that can affect causal inference.  That is the *assignment mechanism*, the process by which some units receive treatment and others do not. It will soon be clear why randomization is the ideal assignment mechanism. Whenever the assignment mechanism is correlated with the potential outcomes, we say that there is **confounding**. Confounding is a problem, since it means that our simple estimate of the ATE is biased.

If you are interested in causal inference, randomized trials are the best approach. In many circumstances, however, randomized trials are not possible due to ethical or practical concerns. In such scenarios there is by necessity a non-random assignment mechanism. The following example of a non-random assignment mechanism illustrates potential problems.

For instance, let’s say you were interested in the effect of college attendence on earnings. People are not randomly assigned to attend college. Rather, people may choose to attend college based on their financial situation, parents’ education, and so on. This can introduce confounding if the assignment mechanism affects future earnings. For example, if people choose to go to college at higher rates when they are on career paths where a college degree is particularly beneficial – or, in RCM language, whose potential outcomes are on average higher under treatment – that would introduce confounding.


Let's look at this idea of a non-random assignment mechanism through a version of the train experiment. Say that one platform has both control and treatment regions. The Spanish speakers would be randomly assigned to regions, and only people within that region would be considered treated. The travelers however are not randomly assigned to a region, and are permitted to move freely on the platform. Despite the random assignment of regions on the platform there still may be confounding. Say that people who have conservative attitudes towards immigrants are hyper-aware of the Spanish being spoken, and therefore choose to stand in the treated regions. This would shift the average attitude of the treated regions higher. It would therefore seem as though the treatment makes people more conservative, when in reality there is bias in the assignment mechanism despite the randomization of regions. From this example, it is clear that when looking at new data, even if it is seemingly randomized, it is important to consider the ways in which there still may confounding. 

Assignment mechanisms can also intentionally be biased in order to manufacture desired outcomes.
`r margin_note("Consider the case of a 'perfect doctor', who knows exactly how a certain drug will impact his patients. He would only give the drug to patients who benefit from the it. This would make the drug seem very beneficial. In reality half of his patients who never took the drug (control group) would have been harmed by taking it.")`
Let's consider a scenario where once again an entire platform is either treated or a control. In this case the assignment mechanism is the choice of the Spanish speakers; they are allowed to choose which platform they want to stand on. Let's also say that they can *perfectly* predict the attitude of people on each platform. The Spanish speakers know that a platform with more liberal attitudes towards immigrants will be more friendly, and therefore always choose to stand on those platforms. In this case, the assignment mechanism of platforms is not random. The Spanish speakers know these averages for the various platforms in the experiment: 

`r margin_note("The ATE in this case is +0.5.")`
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Platform 1", "Platform 2", "Platform 3", "Platform 4", "Platform 5", "Platform 6"),
       ytreat = c("14", "7", "5", "13", "4", "13"),
       ycontrol = c("10", "6", "8", "12", "6", "11"),
       ydiff = c("+4", "+1", "-3", "+1", "-2", "+2")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

`r margin_note("The Spanish speakers in the experiment will choose to stand on the more liberal platforms because they know those platforms are friendlier on average. This assigns the more liberal platforms as 'treated' in this scenario.")`
Based on this knowledge the Spanish speakers in the experiment would choose the following treatment assignments: 
`r margin_note("The estimated ATE in this example would be -5.67.")`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Platform 1", "Platform 2", "Platform 3", "Platform 4", "Platform 5", "Platform 6"),
       ytreat = c("?", "7", "5", "?", "4", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("10", "?", "?", "12", "?", "11"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

The assignment mechanism used distorts the averages of both $Y_t(u)$ and $Y_c(u)$, which in turn distorts the difference in means. The average of the treated group is shifted lower (more liberal), while the average of the control group is shifted higher (more conservative). This gives the illusion that the average treatment effect $\widehat{ATE}$ is negative. The true positive causal effect is masked by this non-random assignment mechanism. 

`r margin_note("This estimate for ATE in this example is -5.67, which is very far from the actual ATE which is  +0.5.")`

Therefore, the difference in means is no longer a good estimate of the ATE. In fact, in this case it has the wrong sign! This is not merely a consequence of our small sample: even if there were a million platforms in the experiment, we could not get a good estimate of the ATE.

<!-- EC: Could be a good place to introduce type S errors to tie in to a future chapter on Type M/S errors (unsure which this would be) -->


This is an extreme example of a problem called **selection bias**. `r margin_note("Selection bias is when the person who is assigning treatment chooses on the basis of potential outcomes.")` The Spanish speakers are not choosing platforms to stand on randomly. Rather, they are making treatment decisions based directly on the potential outcomes of each platform. Remember, whenever the assignment mechanism is correlated with the potential outcomes there is confounding, which is a problem because it means that our estimand is biased. Not all examples of confounding are caused by selection bias, but when there is selection bias there is *always* confounding

Much like how the best way to avoid making poor inferences from a sample to a population is to take a random sample of the population, the best assignment mechanism for avoiding confounding is **randomization**. For each platform we could flip a coin to determine if it is in the treatment or control group.

Randomized assignment is the best assignment mechanism for inferring the average treatment effect because if the sample is large enough, the difference in sample means between treated and control units ($\widehat{ATE}$) will be very close to the actual ATE from that sample. `r margin_note("'Actual ATE' in this case would be the ATE you could calculate if you were omniscient and knew all potential outcomes, which is of course impossible.")` (You still can't know *individual* treatment effects without more assumptions, because of the fundamental problem of causal inference.)

Randomized assignments don't all look the same. For example, randomized block assignment is a method of random assignment that can be useful in further reducing potential confounding, making it an even better estimator than pure random assignment. In random block assignment, subjects in an experiment are subdivided into blocks. The assignment into blocks is not random, instead there is intentionally less variation within blocks than there is between them. Within those blocks subjects are randomly assigned to treatment or control. 

For example, let's use a method of random block assignment with our train study. For example, we might think that there are systematic differences between platforms that might impact the treatment effect. Instead of randomly assigning platforms as control or treated, we could use random block assignment. Each platform would be a block. We could then randomly assign half of the individuals in each block (platform) as control (section of the platform with no Spanish speakers), and the other half as treated (section of the platform with Spanish speakers). The resulting random assignment would look something like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create tibble to show what block randomization would look like

tibble(platforms = c("Platform 1", "Platform 2", "Platform 3"),
       control = c("25", "25", "25"), 
       treated = c("25", "25", "25")) %>%

# Use gt to make it pretty
  
gt() %>%
  cols_label(platforms = "Blocks",
                control = "Control",
                treated = "Treated") %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(platforms))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(platforms))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

Block random assignment ensures that both treated and control groups have an equal proportion of individuals from each platform. This assignment mechanism is a way to remove differences between platforms as a potential source of variability, and therefore minimizing a potential source of confounding. Individuals within each block are still randomly assigned, so this is just an example of a different way to use random assignment. 

If you are interested in causal inference, randomized trials are the best approach. In many circumstances, however, randomized trials are not possible due to ethical or practical concerns. In such scenarios there is by necessity a non-random assignment mechanism.

For example, let's say some of the train platforms in the experiment are so loud the Spanish speakers might not be heard by anyone nearby. Therefore by necessity, only quieter platforms can be assigned to the treatment group. This non-random assignment may introduce confounding. `r margin_note("Maybe the louder platforms have people that are generally more friendly and social. This might be correlated with more liberal attitudes towards immigrants.")` Say there is some systematic difference between the people on quieter platforms compared with the people on the louder platforms. In that case, the assignment mechanism is correlated with potential outcomes, so there is confounding. This means even a simple estimand like ATE would be biased. 

Many statistical methods have been developed for causal inference when there is a non-random assignment mechanism, such as propensity score matching. These methods attempt to correct for the assignment mechanism by finding control units similar to treatment units.  What you should not do is naively compare the sample means under treatment and control and assume that is a good estimate of the ATE.  Without randomization, this could be very misleading!

Now, let's consider our Preceptor Table for Yao, Emma, Cassidy, Tahmid, and Diego again:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Let's say random assignment into treatment was used to get these values.  If that is the case, our estimate $\widehat{ATE} = -1.33$ is an *unbiased* estimate of the ATE.  But how confident in it should we be?  We'll consider that problem now.

### Permutation tests

<!-- Do we keep this section? I think Yes. Permutation tests are cool! And we have room to do them. And they provide a nice excuse to do some R coding! But we can't do any uncertainty here. Need to show Preceptor Table for it, with the null hypothesis filling in all equal (in each row) potential outcomes, and then showing what we observe depending on the assignment mechanism. -->

Even with randomized assignment, when the sample size is small, our estimate $\widehat{ATE}$ may deviate considerably from the actual ATE.  For example, we've considered just one possible random assignment in our train example, where Yao, Emma and Diego receive the treatment.  Here's another possible random assignment, where Yao, Emma and Cassidy receive the treatment:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "11", "?", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "?", "12", "4"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Note that with one assignment, $\widehat{ATE} = -1.33$, while with another $\widehat{ATE} = +3.67$.  Assume that these data are the truth: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid", "Diego"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "11", "9", "5"),
       ycontrol = c("9", "11", "10", "12", "4"),
       ydiff = c("+4", "0", "+1", "-3", "+1")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Thus, the true average treatment effect is $+0.6$.  However, our estimates of the average treatment effect vary because our sample is small and the responses have a large variance. If the sample were larger and the variance were less, the average treatment effect would be closer to the true average treatment effect regardless of the specific units randomly assigned to treatment.

way; thus, there are no references to a "test statistic" or to the "sharp null." Worth keeping?
-->

How can we estimate this uncertainty?  To make things simple, we'll consider a dataset with four subjects.  Let's say we observed the following results, which we know came from a random treatment assignment:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao", "Emma", "Cassidy", "Tahmid"),
       ytreat = c("13", "11", "?", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "10", "12"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

`r margin_note("The estimated ATE in this example is +1.")`
The average treatment effect in this case is positive!  However, how likely is it that we would observe these results if the actual ATE is 0?  That is, how confident should we be that the $\widehat{ATE}$ is actually positive?

To answer this question, we can use a **permutation test**.^[See [this post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/what-is-a-permutation-test/) for a longer discussion.]  The intuition behind a permutation test is simple.  We observed four units, two of which were assigned to treatment and two that were assigned to control.  To conduct a permutation test, we calculate our quantity of interest (here, the difference in means between treated and control) for every possible arrangement of the labels "treatment" and "control" across the four numbers we actually saw.

This is easiest to understand visually:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(Permutation = c("#1", "#2", "#3", "#4", "#5", "#6"),
       `13` = c("T", "T", "T", "C", "C", "C"),
       `11` = c("T", "C", "C", "T", "T", "C"),
       `10` = c("C", "T", "C", "T", "C", "T"),
       `12 ` = c("C", "C", "T", "C", "T", "T"),
       ATE = c("+1", "0", "+2", "-2", "0", "-1")) %>%
       
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(Permutation = md("**Permutation**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(Permutation))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(Permutation))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

Here, permutation #1 is what we actually observed, and permutations #2-6 are all the possible rearrangement of the two "treatment" labels and the two "control" labels.  What do we see?  4/6 (67%) of the permutations produce calculated ATEs are smaller than the effect we actually observed ($+1$), and two of them are the opposite sign!  We therefore should not have much confidence from this data alone that the treatment effect on attitude of being on a platform with Spanish speakers is actually positive.  The moral of the story?  Don't conduct an experiment on only four people!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("03-rubin-causal-model/animations/permutation_4.gif")
```

Let's say that we had a larger experiment.  We can no longer calculate the results of the permutation test by hand, since the number of possible permutations will quickly become very large.  However, you can use R to calculate far more permutations than you can do by hand.  Furthermore, if the number of permutations becomes too much even for your computer, you can take a random sample of all the possible permutations instead; if the random sample is large enough, this will give you a result very close to what you would get if you considered all the permutations

From the permutations, or a random sample of permutations, you can construct a *confidence interval*.  Note that this confidence interval only takes into account the uncertainty from the assignment process---some people being randomly assigned to treatment and others to control.  This necessarily uses only data from your sample.  If you want to make inferences about a larger population, you have to assume that your sample is representative of the larger population.

### Everything is a missing data problem revisited: Internal and external validity

Recall the two main sources of missing data:

<!-- SJ: Confused here, I thought you just said in line chunk 447 that this data doesn't have a causal effect because it is the average US citizen's attitude towards immigrants in general but now it is saying that there is a causal effect that we are likely interested in -->

1. For the units in our sample, we only see one potential outcome
2. For the units outside our sample, we see *no* potential outcomes

<!-- SJ: what is the purpose of having these two bullet points here about how we see only one potential outcome versus none? It seems a little redundant if all it is meant to explain is that we don't know the data for people we haven't surveyed, maybe a little more explanation is needed here to justify what you are explaining or the point you are making. I am assuming (no pun intended) it is because there is no way to make assumptions here?  -->

If we have randomized assignment and a large sample, we can be confident that we have a good estimate of the average treatment effect *in that sample*.  We say that the experiment has high **internal validity**: the inferences we are making are likely to reflect the truth about that sample.  That reflects the first main source of missing data. `r margin_note("We still need more assumptions if we are interested in more difficult estimands within the sample, such as individual treatment effects.")`

However, we may be interested in a population beyond our particular sample, the second main source of missing data.  For example, let's look at the broader context of the train experiment. You likely are not exclusively concerned about the attitudes of people who ride trains, but rather the attitudes of a larger population. Train platforms, however, are a valuable setting in which to run the experiment.  Let's say that we ran a randomized experiment with 10,000 people in Boston, and found an $\widehat{ATE} = -1.33$. Should we assume this estimate would be accurate for a larger general population?

The answer to that question depends in part on the **external validity** of the study. Are the 10,000 people in the study similar to the people who we want to generalize the findings to?  Let's say that the 10,000 people in Boston all choose to ride trains for environmental reasons. That's another form of **selection bias**. The sample is not randomly selected from the population in which we are interested.  Why is that a problem?  Those people differ systematically from other people in a way that may affect their response to the experiment. For example, their preference of public transportation for environmental reasons may be correlated to other political beliefs.

Note that this concern can be expressed in terms of the assignment mechanism.  People who don't ride the train have a 0% chance of receiving the treatment.  Thus, the study *can't* directly speak to how the treatment would impact their attitudes towards immigrants. The only way we can make such claims is by making additional assumptions, such as that train-riders reflect the same makeup of political beliefs as people who don't ride trains.

The circumstances of the experiment may also affect the external validity of the study. Perhaps the train study was conducted during the middle of the summer when platforms are uncomfortably hot. Then, while we have variation in one aspect of the treatment (whether there were Spanish speakers nearby), we don't have variation in another (temperature of train platform). It may be that attitude towards immigrants is impacted when the train platform is uncomfortably hot, but the treatment has no impact on attitude otherwise.

When dealing with human subjects, there is a particular concern regarding external validity: the [**Hawthorne effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect).  When human subjects know that they are part of an experiment, they may change their behavior.

In this example, the Hawthorne effect can impact attitudes expressed on surveys. Maybe respondents are more extreme in their attitude in either direction (more liberal or more conservative) because the survey is an opportunity to express opinion. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="From 'Public Opinion Polls and Survey Research' by Graham R. Walden.", fig.fmargin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("03-rubin-causal-model/images/survey_screenshot.png")
```

### Scale

In the train example, a scale is being used to understand attitude towards immigrants of subjects in the study. The scale goes from 3 (most liberal) to 15 (most conservative). As we discussed earlier, one way of filling in the missing data is by using $\tau$ which let's assume is the same for all subjects in our study, and is $-1.33$. `r margin_note("See 'How do we fill in the missing values?'")` 

Say Jessica and Miro are subjects in our study for which we want to fill in the missing values.  

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
tibble(subject = c("Jessica", "Miro"),
       ytreat = c("?", "?"),
       ycontrol = c("3", "15"),
       ydiff = c("-1.33", "-1.33")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

For Miro it is easy, we would estimate his treated attitude to be $13.67$. For Jessica things seem to get more complicated. Our scale does not go below 3, so an estimated control attitude of $1.67$ doesn't make any sense. We would have the same issue for Miro if the $\tau$ we were using to fill in values was positive. This highlights a potential issue that can arise when using a scale, which is **censoring**. Censoring in statistics is when the value of a measurement is only partially known. In this case, Jessica might have an attitude score of 3, which we understand as the most liberal on our scale. In reality her attitude may be more liberal than is possible to capture with our survey scale. So, we only partially know her attitude. We know it is very liberal, but we don't have any sense of if it is more liberal than our scale allows for, or by how much. 

Ideally, we want everyone's attitude scores to fall somewhere in the middle of our scale so we don't have this issue of censoring. If a large percentage of our subjects have an attitude score on one extreme or another of our scale, this would give us an idea that our scale likely needs to be adjusted. 

> "Then we should think about the mechanism that led to observed values being observed and unobserved values being missing. To me, statistical inference concerns estimating missing values from observed values rather than pondering p-values, and one cannot even begin to do this without assuming something about the process that created the missing values: was it, for example, simple random sampling or was it a censoring mechanism? ... We should not avoid discussing the scientific context of any statistical problem, because this can greatly affect the resulting inference." ^[Rubin 2011]
`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Don Rubin')`

### More complex models for causal inference

In this chapter, we explained that there are many possible causal estimands that may be of interest, discussed one in greater detail (the ATE), and provided an estimator for that estimand---the difference in means between treatment and control, which we called $\widehat{ATE}$.  But more complex models can help both with estimating the ATE and with estimating more complex estimands.

We will cover these topics more when we discuss regression and other models, but moving beyond a simple difference in means can help a lot with causal inference:

1. More complex models can help correct for non-random treatment assignments, if the factors that lead to treatment assignment are known.
1. More complex models can also help with estimating different treatment effects for different groups.  Recall we discussed the possible assumption that are different treatment effects for Democrats and Republicans, $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$.  While you could just calculate the difference in means for each group, that may lead to small sample sizes, especially if there are a lot of groups.  More complex models can help *pool* information across groups to get better estimates. 
1. Finally, the difference in means doesn't work with continuous treatments, such as taking Spanish being spoken at Volume level 3 or Volume level 4. `r margin_note("We look at this in later chapters.")` Regression and other models can handle continuous treatments much better.

### Causal inference and prediction

Causal inference is often compared with prediction.  In prediction, we want to know an outcome, $Y(u)$.  In causal inference, we want to know a function of *potential* outcomes, such as a treatment effect $Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$.

Note, however, that these are both kinds of missing data problems.  Prediction involves getting an estimate for an outcome variable that we don't have, and thus is missing, whether because it is in the future or because it is from data that we are unable to collect.  Thus, prediction is the term for using statistical inference to fill in missing data for outcomes.

Causal inference, however, is the term for filling in missing data for potential outcomes.  Unlike with prediction, only one potential outcome can *ever* be observed, even in principle.  (If you are forecasting the weather, you can compare your forecast from yesterday to the actual weather today.)  In a way, however, this is still a kind of prediction: it is just a prediction about a quantity you can't ever observe (a potential outcome).

In both causal inference and prediction, the process by which some data is missing and some is observed is crucial.  If we think that the missing data is similar to the observed data, we can make inferences more easily.  If not, we have to think through the dissimilarities and consider how to model them.

### Causal vs. Predictive Models

Models help us to infer things in both prediction and causal inference. This chapter is all about the Rubin Causal Model, so naturally we have been focusing on causal models. We should, however, also discuss predictive models and the subtleties that differentiate predictive and causal models. 

Remember that all we care about is forecasting some value $Y(u)$ given that we know $X$. This means we only have one column of outcomes for each value $X$. Let's continue using the train example, and say that $X_1$ is being under 50 years old, and $X_2$ is being 50 or older. 

Let's see what this would look like in a table similar to a Preceptor Table:

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
tibble(x = c("Under 50", "50 and Over"),
       y = c("9.21", "9")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(x = md("$$\\mathbf{X}$$"),
                y = md("$$Y(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(x))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(x))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

In this model, given someone is under 50 years old we would predict a $Y(u)$ value of $9.21$. Similarly, $9$ would be the prediction given $X$ is someone over 50 years old. We have made strong assumptions to create this predictive model and should be aware of the implications of those assumptions. Do we think the predictions we could make using this model are realistic? Probably not. But hopefully from this example the differences between predictive and causal models may be a little more clear.

An important distinction to notice is that there is only one $Y(u)$ value for each $X$. This is very different to the RCM we are used to where there are two potential outcomes (treated and control). There is only one outcome column in a predictive model, whereas there are two or more in a causal model. 

With a predictive model we cannot infer what would happen to the outcome $Y(u)$ if we changed $X$. This is also different to what we are used to from a causal model where we are trying to understand the causal effect of some change (treatment). From our predictive model, we can compare the two groups and note that we would predict people under 50 to have an attitude score slightly more conservative than those 50 and over. We cannot claim, however, that we understand what would happen to an individual's attitude once they turn 50 (confounding!). Similarly, we cannot make any estimate of what an individual's attitude might have been when they were under 50 years old. As you will soon read about, age is not something we can ever estimate a causal effect for.

## Other issues with causal inference

### No causation without manipulation

In order for a potential outcome to make sense, it must be possible, at least *a priori*. For example, if there is no way for Yao, under any circumstance, to ever be in the train study, then $Y_{t}(u)$ is impossible for him. It can never happen. And if $Y_{t}(u)$ can never be observed, even in theory, then the causal effect of treatment on Yao's attitude is undefined. 

The causal effect of the train study is well defined because it is the simple difference of two potential outcomes, both of which might happen. In this case, we (or something else) can manipulate the world, at least conceptually, so that it is possible that one thing or a different thing might happen.

This definition of causal effects becomes much more problematic if there is no way for one of the potential outcomes to happen, ever. For example, what is the causal effect of Yao's height on his weight? It might seem we would just need to compare two potential outcomes: what would Yao's weight be under the treatment (where treatment is defined as being 3 inches taller) and what would Yao's weight be under the control (where control is defined as his current height).

A moment's reflection highlights the problem: we can't increase Yao's height. There is no way to observe, even conceptually, what Yao's weight would be if he were taller because there is no way to make him taller. We can't manipulate Yao's height, so it makes no sense to investigate the causal effect of height on weight. Hence the slogan: *No causation without manipulation.*

This then raises the question of what can and cannot be manipulated. If something cannot be manipulated, we can't consider it causal. So can race ever be considered causal? What about sex? A genetic condition like color-blindness? Can we manipulate these characteristics? In the modern world these questions are not simple. 

Take color-blindness for example. Say we are interested in how color-blindness impacts ability to complete a jig-saw puzzle. Because color-blindness is genetic some might argue it cannot be manipulated. But advances in technology like gene-therapy might allow us to actually change someones genes. Could we then claim the ability to manipulate color-blindness? If yes, we could then measure the causal effect of color-blindness on ability to complete jig-saw puzzles.

The problem is still very complicated even if we can manipulate genes. Gene therapy is not straight forward. Genes interact with each other in ways that scientists are still trying to understand. It is unlikely the gene that controls color-blindness could be manipulated in isolation. Again, these questions are very complicated and don't have clear answers.

Take another example of an experiment where race is "manipulated" on resumes by changing names. Social scientists have studied how names can signal race, so this might seem like a reasonable way to manipulate race. The problem is a name might signal race, but race isn't as simple as a name. In that case, what causal effect are you really studying? It is not just 'names', because you are choosing names based on their ability to signal race. You also are not just manipulating race, because race is not solely determined by having a certain name.  

The slogan of "No causation without manipulation" may at first seem straight forward, but it is clearly not so simple. Questions about race, sex, gender and genetics are very complex and should be considered with care. 

### Other solutions to the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference 

The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that it is impossible to observe two potential outcomes at once, which means one or more potential outcomes are always missing (counterfactuals). Throughout this chapter we use a statistical solution to the Fundamental Problem. We accept the fact that we cannot observe some potential outcomes, and instead use techniques to understand causal effects despite some missing data. 

Other solutions to the Fundamental Problem are commonly used in hard sciences (think chemistry and biology labs). It is still impossible to observe more than one potential outcome *at once*, however, assumptions of homogeneity allow someone to believe they can observe both potential outcomes. 

For example, say you wanted to know the causal effect of an acid on a piece of metal. In a chemistry lab, you might go about understanding this causal effect in two ways. One way would be to measure some variable about a piece of metal before you put it in acid, and then measure that same piece of metal again after you've put it in acid. That would give you the two potential outcomes (control - before acid, treated - after acid) from which you could calculate a causal effect. Although this may seem straight forward, you are making still assumptions which allow you to believe this is a reasonable experiment. You are assuming the piece of metal is fairly static, nothing is changing about it from one moment to the next. You are likely also working to control other variables in the environment (like temperature) to support your assumption of homogeneity. Even if the assumptions you make are valid, they are still assumptions. Another method often used in hard sciences is assuming homogeneity between units. In this experiment, that would look like using two very similar pieces of metal to be both control and treated. You could then calculate causal effect through direct comparison. There is an assumption that the two pieces of metal are similar enough that the only difference between them is if they are treated or not. 

This solution to the Fundamental Problem using assumptions of homogeneity have been successful in hard sciences, but often would not make any sense in social sciences. For example in our train experiment, it would be unreasonable to assume two individuals are exactly the same. It might be tempting to say an individual is constant enough in their beliefs from one minute to the next that we could measure their attitude before and after being on the train platform with Spanish speakers. Even if that assumption is realistic, we have no way of proving it. 

Instead we will avoid using any assumptions of homogeneity in our statistical solution to the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. We can still understand something about causal effect while not seeing all potential outcomes. 

The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is the idea that we cannot observe multiple potential outcomes for the *same unit* at the *exact same time*. There are multiple approaches to overcoming this problem to understand causal effect. We use a statistical approach that does not assume homogeneity across units or time.

### Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)

One important assumption for causal inference is that "the [potential outcome] observation on one unit should be unaffected by the particular assignment of treatments to the other units."^[Cox 1958, §2.4.] This is called the **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption** (**SUTVA**). 

In the context of our example, Yao's attitude should not depend on Emma's. But what if it does? Suppose that upon hearing Spanish on the platform, Emma makes a comment to Yao about immigration which shifts his opinion. Yao might not have thought anything of the Spanish being spoken nearby, but Emma's comment changes his individual survey answers. Therefore, his outcome will depend on both which treatment he received and which treatment Emma receives.

SUTVA violation makes causal inference more difficult. We can account for dependent observations by considering more treatments. We create 4 treatments by taking into account whether or not Emma receives treatment:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Yao"),
       ct = "10",
       tt = "9",
       cc = "13",
       tc = "12") %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty.
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Subject**"),
             ct = md("Yao = c,<br />Emma = t"),
             tt = md("Yao = t,<br />Emma = t"),
             cc = md("Yao = c,<br />Emma = c"),
             tc = md("Yao = t,<br />Emma = c")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

Recall that a causal effect is defined as the difference between two potential outcomes. In this case, there are multiple causal effects because there are more than two potential outcomes:

`r margin_note("(Yao = t & Emma = t) - (Yao = c & Emma = t)")`
- One is the causal effect on Yao when Emma receives treatment ($9-10$).
`r margin_note("(Yao = t & Emma = c) - (Yao = c & Emma = c)")`
- Another is the causal effect  on Yao when Emma does not receive treatment ($12-13$).
`r margin_note("(Yao = c & Emma = t) - (Yao = c & Emma = c)")`
- A third is the causal effect of Emma's treatment on Yao when Yao is not treated ($10-12$). In other words, we can define a causal effect on Yao even in situation in which Yao's treatment is identical in both situations.

Note that Emma being treated has a larger causal effect on Yao than Yao himself being treated!

By considering more potential outcomes in this way, we can cause SUTVA to hold. However, if any units other than Yao are dependent on Emma (like someone overhears Emma), then we must consider further potential outcomes. The greater the number of dependent units, the more potential outcomes we must consider and the more complex the calculations become (consider an experiment with 20 different people, each of whose treatment status can affect outcomes for every one else). In order (easily) to estimate the causal effect of a single treatment relative to a control, SUTVA should hold. 

### Correlation with Potenial Outcomes

When considering the relationship between a treatment and an outcome, one of the most important assumptions is a lack of correlation between treatment assignment and the potential outcomes. Consider a version of the train experiment. Assume that, if a Republican is not on the platform with Spanish speakers, they will have an attitude value of X. If they were on a platform where they could hear Spanish, their attitude would have been X + 2. A Democrat would have an attitude X regardless of whether or not they are on the platform with Spanish speakers. In other words, the causal effect of being in the treatment group is +2 for Republicans, and 0 for Democrats. If we could run an experiment with random assignment, we would discover that the average causal effect is somewhere between 0 and 2, depending on the relative proportion of the Republicans and Democrats.

`r margin_note("Let's say here attitude X is 9.")`
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("R", "R", "D", "R", "D"),
       ytreat = c("11", "11", "9", "11", "9"),
       ycontrol = c("9", "9", "9", "9", "9"),
       ydiff = c("+2", "+2", "0", "+2", "0")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Unfortunately (?), people do not choose to ride certain trains randomly. We might assume/hope that there is no correlation between which train you ride and potential outcomes. If this is true, then we would still be able to estimate the causal effect. Yet that is rarely true in general. What if, instead, all the Republicans are in the control group, and all the Democrats are in the treated? In that case, everyone has an attidue of X! And it appears that the presence of Spanish speakers on the platform "does not matter". The correlation between treatment and potential outcomes invalidates the naive estimate of the average treatment effect.

`r margin_note("Say all the Republicans ride trains from Platform 1 (control), and all Democrats ride Platform 2 (treated). Here we find an estimated ATE of 0.")`
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("R", "R", "D", "R", "D"),
       ytreat = c("?", "?", "9", "?", "9"),
       ycontrol = c("9", "9", "?", "9", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("$$\\mathbf{Subject}$$"),
                ytreat = md("$$Y_t(u)$$"),
                ycontrol = md("$$Y_c(u)$$"),
                ydiff = md("$$Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)$$")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)
```

Keep in mind that the problem arises when there is a correlation between treatment assignment and *potential* outcome, not simply a correlation between treatment assignment and outcome. In this case, the correlation between treatment assignment and outcome is zero! Everyone has the same salary. Just looking at the outcomes we observe is not enough. We must make assumptions about the outcomes we don't observe, about what would have happened.

### Natural Experiments: Hormone Replacement Therapy

Remember - 

> "We should not avoid discussing the scientific context of any statistical problem, because this can greatly affect the resulting inference." ^[Rubin 2011]
`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Don Rubin')`

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("03-rubin-causal-model/images/HRT.png")
```

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is an example of a 'natural experiment' that was extremely biased and therefore had serious negative consequences for many people. Hormone replacement therapy gained traction in the mid-1990's as a successful way to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease in women. Many women were put on long-term estrogen replacement therapy because of its supposed benefits to prevent cardiovascular disease. Once randomized trials happened, this belief was quickly overturned as it was found that HRT was in fact not beneficial at all.

How did people come to the conclusion that HRT was beneficial when it was not? This was an example of extreme bias in the assignment mechanism of the groups being compared. In the original study, the women who chose to take HRT were fundamentally different than those who did not. In this case, there was "healthy user bias", so the women who chose HRT were different from those who did not in ways that reduced potential negative health risks (they tended to be more generally 'health consicious', exercise more, visit the doctors). They also may have been better at adhering to prescriptions, which also correlates with likelihood to do other healthy things consistently like exercise and diet. Socioeconomic status was also not adjusted for in the original study.

Randomized trials rapidly proved HRT to be harmful rather than beneficial. Women who began taking HRT because of its supposed health benefits were hurt through this process. Lack of consideration of confounding, randomization, and heterogenous treatment effects all had serious negative effects on real people. 

## Conclusion

The causal effect of a treatment on a single unit at a point in time is the difference between the outcome variable with the treatment and without the treatment. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that it is impossible to observe the causal effect on a single unit. As a consequence, assumptions---models---must be used in order to estimate the missing data.

`r margin_note("We start with the Enos train study, which aims to understand how proximity to people speaking Spanish might impact peoples attitudes towards immigrants. Our data is based off of a survey that gives a numerical representation of attitude. We want to understand treatment effect, so our estimand of focus is ATE. We have discussed the fundamental problem of causal inference, and the concept that ev erything is a missing data problem.")`

> "We should start the inferential process with clear statements of scientific objectives and associated estimands, and a precise description of the hypothetical data set from which we would simply calculate the estimands. Such a data set could be composed mostly of unobserved or even unobservable values, but it defines the objects of inference. 

`r margin_note("We have considered the assignment mechanism, and different ways confounding can be introduced in our data.")`

> "Then we should think about the mechanism that led to observed values being observed and unobserved values being missing. To me, statistical inference concerns estimating missing values from observed values rather than pondering p-values, and one cannot even begin to do this without assuming something about the process that created the missing values: was it, for example, simple random sampling or was it a censoring mechanism?

`r margin_note("We have also discussed some ways in which we can fill the missing values in our data.")`

> "This inferential process is most directly conceptualized as finding the probability distribution of missing values given observed values and scientific assumptions, i.e., formally, finding the posterior predictive distribution of the missing values, whence the posterior distribution of the estimands can be calculated.

`r margin_note("Models require assumptions. The assumptions we make should not be taken lightly, as they can have real world impacts, as we saw in the hormonal replacement therapy example.")`

> "There is no need to teach technical details of this Bayesian approach; instead we can use ideas based on simulating the unknowns under scientifically motivated models. We should not avoid discussing the scientific context of any statistical problem, because this can greatly affect the resulting inference. The approach of distributionally filling in (or multiply imputing) the missing values is intuitive and reveals the natural uncertainty of inference. ... 

> "After understanding this natural approach to access uncertainty of inference, then we can teach the importance of evaluating operating characteristics of such procedures." ^[Rubin 2011]

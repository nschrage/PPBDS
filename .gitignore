# I don't see a need to have html files at the highest level.

*.html

# I get annoyed at checking in a libs/ folder everywhere, but maybe we should
# check them in? If you don't, then, unless you have build the html
# file for a chapter yourself, it won't show up nicely when you open it.

**/*libs

# I don't think that it matters that these files are not pushed for each chapter.
# Might need to revisit this if we start cache'ing results so that the book builds faster.

# Never check in caches. This file name is set in common.R

cache-directory

# No matter what happens above, everything in docs/ must be checked in

!docs/*

# Everything in m-s-errors and simpsons must be checked in for flipbook to fully work

!m-s-errors/*
!simpsons-paradox/*

# Only the book-builder needs to deal with this file. It gets replaced
# everytime you knit a chapter, so it should just be ignored.

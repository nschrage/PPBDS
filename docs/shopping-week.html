<!-- To-Do -->
<!-- 1. Put the Kant quote in a side margin and add a picture. -->
<!-- 2. Add some sidemargin notes which provide more detail during the Set Up section. Most won't care what those weird R commands are doing but, for those that do, an explanation would be polite. -->
<!-- 3. How should we end this chapter? Perhaps with some cool example graphics. Take this course to build these things? -->
<blockquote>
<p>The usual touchstone of whether what someone asserts is mere persuasion or at least a subjective conviction, i.e., firm belief, is betting. Often someone pronounces his propositions with such confident and inflexible defiance that he seems to have entirely laid aside all concern for error. A bet disconcerts him. Sometimes he reveals that he is persuaded enough for one ducat but not for ten. For he would happily bet one, but at 10 he suddenly becomes aware of what he had not previously noticed, namely that it is quite possible that he has erred. -— Immanuel Kant, <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em></p>

<p>First, the book is for students in <a href="https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html">Gov 50: Data</a> and <a href="https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html">Gov 52: Models</a>, courses offered in the Government Department at Harvard University. Everything about the book is designed to make the experience of those students better. Some of the material here may be useful to students outside of this class, but I don’t really care if it is.</p>

</div>
<p>Throughout this book, we assume that you are using R via RStudio. R is like a car’s engine while RStudio is like a car’s dashboard.</p>
<p>More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em> that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.</p>
<p>You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. Install R first and then install RStudio.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>You must do this first:</strong> <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/">Download and install R</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You must do this second:</strong> <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">Download and install RStudio Desktop</a> (the free version).</p></li>

</div>
<p>Recall our car analogy from earlier. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new <em>programs</em> (also called <em>applications</em>) you can open. We’ll always work in RStudio and not in the R application.</p>
<p>Although doing so is experimental, we allow for two modes of working with R and RStudio. First, is on your own computer. Second, is using FAS OnDemand, available from our Canvas page. We will try to highlight any differences between the two approaches but, because they both use R and RStudio, there are not many. We recommend that students try out both over the course of the semester.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">FAS OnDemand provides a very similar experience to <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a>, a paid service. Most data science today is done on your own machine, Most data science in the future will be done in the cloud.</span></span></p>
<p>Let’s begin with getting familiar with RStudio, whether on your own machine or on FAS OnDemand. Begin by opening up RStudio. After you open RStudio, you should see three <em>panes</em>, or panels, dividing the screen: the <em>console pane</em>, the <em>files pane</em>, and the <em>environment pane</em>. You should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="00-shopping-week/images/rstudio.png" width="1440"></p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">Note that slight differences will exist as RStudio changes over time.</span></span></p>
<p>This is your workspace! You can see three main windows right now. Let’s focus on the big one on the left:</p>
<p><img src="00-shopping-week/images/left_window.png" width="776"></p>
<p>There are three tabs in this window, we’ll be focusing on the Console and Terminal. When you first start R, the Console gives you some information about your version of R. At the time when this was written, 4.0.1 was the latest version of R! The Console is where you can type and run R code. For example, if you type 1 + 1 and hit return, the Console returns 2.</p>
<p>Next, let’s move to the top right:</p>
<p><img src="00-shopping-week/images/top_right_window.png" width="653"></p>
<p>Here, the main two tabs you’ll be using are Environment and Git (which is not yet available). The Environment tab shows you the datasets and variables you currently have loaded into RStudio. In this case, we loaded in a dataset with 3407 rows and 5 columns and a variable x equal to 5. For you, the Environment should be empty, so let’s change that!</p>
<p>To create your first variable in RStudio, go to your Console and type:</p>
<pre eval="FALSE"><code>x &lt;- 5</code></pre>
<p>Now, hit return/enter and you should see a variable x equal to 5 in your Environment! You must always hit return/enter after typing a command, otherwise RStudio will not realize that you want R to execute the command. The bottom right window:</p>
<p><img src="00-shopping-week/images/bottom_right_window.png" width="653"></p>
<p>Here, the Files tab will allow you to see your computer’s file system. When you create a project later, this tab will automatically show the contents in your project’s folder. The plots tab will show you a preview of any plots you make in RStudio. Packages shows all the packages you have installed in RStudio so far. Help will be <a href="tools.html#how-to-get-help">explained later</a> in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-set-up" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Initial Set Up</h3>
<p>Whether you are working on FAS OnDemand or on your own computer, the next step is to copy and paste the following in to the R Console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb2-1"></a><span class="kw">options</span>(<span class="dt">pkgType =</span> <span class="st">"binary"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb2-2"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(rstudioapi)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb2-3"></a>rstudioapi<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw">writeRStudioPreference</span>(<span class="dt">name =</span> <span class="st">"load_workspace"</span>, <span class="dt">value =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb2-4"></a>rstudioapi<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw">writeRStudioPreference</span>(<span class="dt">name =</span> <span class="st">"save_workspace"</span>, <span class="dt">value =</span> <span class="st">"never"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first causes R to download binary (i.e., pre-built) packages by default. Without this option set to “binary,” you will occasionally be asked by R:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb3-1"></a><span class="ex">Do</span> you want to install from sources the packages which </span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb3-2"></a><span class="ex">need</span> compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Unless you have a good reason not to, always answer “no” to this question.</p>
<p>The <code>rstudioapi</code> commands set sensible defaults for working with RStudio. You only have to execute those commands one time.</p>
</div>
<div id="package-installation" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Package installation</h3>
<p>Another point of confusion with many new R users is the idea of an R package. R packages, also known as R libraries, extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free.</p>
<p>For example, among the many packages we will use in this book is the <strong>remotes</strong> package.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-17"></span>
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
FIGURE 0.3: Analogy of R versus R packages.
</p>
<img src="00-shopping-week/images/R_vs_R_packages.png" alt="Analogy of R versus R packages." width="648">
</div>
<p>R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play.</p>
<p>Let’s continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a photo you have just taken with friends on Instagram. You need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Install the app</em>: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you’re set for the time being. You might need to do this again in the future when there is an update to the app.</li>
<li>
<em>Open the app</em>: After you’ve installed Instagram, you need to open it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:</p>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-18"></span>
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
FIGURE 0.4: Installing versus loading an R package
</p>
<img src="00-shopping-week/images/install_vs_load.jpg" alt="Installing versus loading an R package" width="402">
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Install the package</em>: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you’ve installed a package, you likely won’t install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version.</li>
<li>
<em>“Load” the package</em>: “Loading” a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not “loaded” by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to “load” each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s perform these two steps for the <strong>remotes</strong> package.</p>
<p>Type <code>install.packages("remotes")</code> in the console pane of RStudio and press Return/Enter on your keyboard. Note you must include the quotation marks around the name of the package.</p>
<p>R packages generally live in one of two places: CRAN (rhymes with “clan”) for more mature, popular packages and Github for more experimental, less stable packages. <code>install.packages()</code> gets packages from CRAN. At the end of this section, we will also install one package from Github.</p>
</div>
<div id="package-loading" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Package loading</h3>
<p>Recall that after you’ve installed a package, you need to “load it.” In other words, you need to “open it.” We do this by using the <code>library()</code> command.</p>
<p>For example, to load the <strong>remotes</strong> package, run the following code in the console pane. What do we mean by “run the following code”? Either type or copy-and-paste the following code into the console pane and then hit the Enter key.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb4-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(remotes)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If after running the earlier code, a blinking cursor returns next to the <code>&gt;</code> “prompt” sign, it means you were successful and the <strong>remotes</strong> package is now loaded and ready to use. If, however, you get a red “error message” that reads:</p>
<pre><code>Error in library(remotes) : there is no package called ‘remotes’</code></pre>
<p>you haven’t successfully install it. This is an example of an “error message”. If you get this error message, go back to the subsection on R package installation and make sure to install the <strong>remotes</strong> package before proceeding.</p>
<p>For historical reasons “packages” are also known as “libraries,” which is why the relevant command for loading them is <code>library()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="package-use" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Package use</h3>
<p>One very common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is to forget to load them first by using the <code>library()</code> command we just saw. Remember: <em>you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.</em> If you don’t load a package before attempting to use one of its features, you’ll see an error message similar to:</p>
<pre><code>Error: could not find function</code></pre>
<p>This is a different error message than the one you just saw about a package not having been installed yet. R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been loaded. R doesn’t know where to find the function you are using. Almost all new users forget to do this when starting out.</p>
<p>Now, we will be installing a package which is not available from CRAN: <strong>PPBDS.data</strong>. Copy and paste the following to the R Console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb7-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(remotes)</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="shopping-week.html#cb7-2"></a>remotes<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw">install_github</span>(<span class="st">"davidkane9/PPBDS.data"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will result in many new packages being installed. It may take a minute or two. If something gets messed up, it is often useful to <code>remove.packages()</code> the problematic package and then install it again.</p>
<p>If you are working on FAS OnDemand, none of these steps were necessary. We did everything for you already.</p>
</div>
<div id="tutorials" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>For each chapter of the textbook, there is a corresponding tutorial available in the <strong>PPBDS.data</strong> package. In order to access these tutorials, follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Run <code>library(PPBDS.data)</code> in the R Console.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="00-shopping-week/images/run_ppbds.PNG" width="580"></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can access the tutorials via the Tutorial pane in the top right tab in RStudio. Click “Start tutorial” for the “Shopping Week” tutorial. If you don’t see any tutorials, try clicking the “Home” button – the little house symbol with the thin red roof in the upper right.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="00-shopping-week/images/tutorial_pane.gif"></p>
<p>In order to expand the window, you can drag and enlarge the tutorial pane inside RStudio. In order to open a popup window, click the “Show in New Window” icon next to the home icon.</p>
<p>You may notice that the Jobs tab will create output as the tutorial is starting up. This is because RStudio is running the code to create the tutorial. If you accidentally clicked “Start Tutorial” and would like to stop the job from running, you can click the back arrow in the Jobs tab, and then press the red stop sign icon.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Your work will be saved between sessions, so you can complete the tutorial in multiple sittings. In order to complete the tutorial successfully, make sure you enter your name at the very beginning and answer all questions. Once you have completed the tutorial, follow the instructions on the tutorial <code>Submit</code> page and upload the resulting <code>tutorial_responses.rds</code> file to Canvas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tutorials are graded pass/fail. It is very hard to fail. As long as you make an honest attempt, you will pass easily.</p>
<p><img src="00-shopping-week/images/tutorial_popup.gif"></p>
<p>You’ve finished a tutorial! Now what? There are a few ways you can close out of a tutorial safely so you can quit your RStudio session.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you clicked “Show in new window” and were working on the tutorial in a pop-up window, simply X out of the pop-up window</li>
<li>If you were working on the tutorial inside the Tutorial pane of RStudio, simply press the red stop sign icon</li>

Functions/other things to include in the textbook: --><!-- - How to remove columns with the select() function (as opposed to keeping columns—i.e. using a minus sign) --><!-- - n(), which counts total # of rows [in each group], especially alongside group_by() and summarize(). --><!-- - coord_cartesian() and xlim/ylim, which allows for zooming/rescaling graphs. --><!-- - if_else() and case_when() from dplyr, especially alongside mutate(). --><!-- - as.factor(), especially alongside mutate(). --><!-- - scales in general, and in particular, RColorBrewer and viridis. --><!-- - using scales to change the name and labels of a legend. --><!-- - tidyr's drop_na(). --><!-- - facet_grid() to facet by more than 1 variable. --><!-- - %%, the modulo operator. --><!-- In addition, some functions that I don't use super often but would be nice to include in the textbook if you want to: --><!-- - the max() and min() functions, especially alongside summarize(). --><!-- - dplyr's ntile() function to turn continuous data into categorical data. --><!-- - the n_unique() function, a more selective version of n(). --><!-- 0) No warnings or other messages. --><!-- 1) Plots are ordered alphabetically if it is a character and by levels if it is a factor. Dates appear differently in plots. reorder() is useful. Cover this at start of advanced plotting. --><!-- 2) Purpose of Advanced plotting is to show the tools for making the plots that appear in socviz.co, chapters 3 and 4.  --><!-- 4) Good stuff here: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/ggplot2-3-3-0/. Like scale_x_binned(); geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)))  --><!-- 5) Add Conclusion. Include brief descriptions, pretty pictures from cool packages like: ggrepel, gghighlights, plotly. Others? --><!-- 6) Make a conclusion. What have we learned? What can you do now? What's coming next? Maybe finish with one last data pipe into a nice graphic, sort of a graduation exercise. --><!-- 7) Use r scales::comma() throughout --><!-- 8) Give enough detail that you can do Congressional age exercise. -->

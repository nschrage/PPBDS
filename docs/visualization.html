</p>
<p>Throughout this book, we assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest, R is like a car’s engine while RStudio is like a car’s dashboard.</p>
<p>More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em> that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Installing R and RStudio</h3>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. It is important that you install R first and then install RStudio.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>You must do this first:</strong> Download and install R by going to <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cloud.r-project.org/</a>. </p></li>

<p>Recall our car analogy from earlier. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new <em>programs</em> (also called <em>applications</em>) you can open. We’ll always work in RStudio and not in the R application.</p>

<p>After you open RStudio, you should see three <em>panes</em>, or panels, dividing the screen: the <em>console pane</em>, the <em>files pane</em>, and the <em>environment pane</em>. Over the course of this chapter, you’ll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serves.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> How do I code in R?</h2>
<p>Now that you’re set up with R and RStudio, you are probably asking yourself, “OK. Now how do I use R?”. The first thing to note is that unlike other statistical software programs like Excel, SPSS, or Minitab that provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_and_click">point-and-click</a> interfaces, R is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language">interpreted language</a>. This means you have to type in commands written in <em>R code</em>. In other words, you have to code/program in R. Note that we’ll use the terms “coding” and “programming” interchangeably in this book.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">If you are new to the world of coding, R, and RStudio and feel you could benefit from a more detailed introduction, we suggest you check out the short book, <a href="https://rbasics.netlify.com/"><em>Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown</em></a>. It includes screencast recordings that you can follow along and pause as you learn. This book also contains an introduction to R Markdown, a tool used for reproducible research in R.</span></span></p>
<p>While it is not required to be a seasoned coder/computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that new R users need to understand.</p>
<div id="tips-on-learning-to-code" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Tips on learning to code</h3>
<p>Learning to code/program is quite similar to learning a foreign language. It can be daunting and frustrating at first. Such frustrations are common and it is normal to feel discouraged as you learn. However, just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn and improve.</p>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>Here are a few useful tips to keep in mind as you learn to program:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Remember that computers are not actually that smart</strong>: You may think your computer or smartphone is “smart,” but really people spent a lot of time and energy designing them to appear “smart.” In reality, you have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore, the instructions you give your computer can’t have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way.</li>
<li>
<strong>Take the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach</strong>: Especially when you learn your first programming language or you need to understand particularly complicated code, it is often much easier to take existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends. This is as opposed to trying to type out the code from scratch. We call this the <em>“copy, paste, and tweak”</em> approach. So early on, we suggest not trying to write code from memory, but rather take existing examples we have provided you, then copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. After you start feeling more confident, you can slowly move away from this approach and write code from scratch. Think of the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach as training wheels for learning to ride a bike. After getting comfortable, you won’t need them anymore.</li>
<li>
<strong>The best way to learn to code is by doing</strong>: Rather than learning to code for its own sake, we find that learning to code goes much smoother when you have a goal in mind or when you are working on a particular project, like analyzing data that you are interested in and that is important to you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Practice is key</strong>: Just as the only method to improve your foreign language skills is through lots of practice and speaking, the only method to improving your coding skills is through lots of practice. Write R code every day.</li>
</ul>

<div id="basic-programming-concepts-and-terminology" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Basic programming concepts and terminology</h3>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>We now introduce some basic programming concepts and terminology. Instead of asking you to memorize all these concepts and terminology right now, we’ll guide you so that you’ll “learn by doing.” To help you learn, we will always use a different font to distinguish regular text from <code>computer_code</code>. The best way to master these topics is, in our opinions, through <a href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory">deliberate practice</a> with R and lots of repetition.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Console pane</em>: where you enter in commands.</li>
<li>
<em>Running code</em>: the act of telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the console.</li>
<li>
<em>Objects</em>: where values are saved in R. We’ll show you how to <em>assign</em> values to objects and how to display the contents of objects.</li>
<li>
<em>Data types</em>: integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, and characters. Integers are values like -1, 0, 2, 4092. Doubles or numerics are a larger set of values containing both the integers but also fractions and decimal values like -24.932 and 0.8. Logicals are either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> while characters are text such as “cabbage”, “Hamilton”, “The Wire is the greatest TV show ever”, and “This ramen is delicious.” Note that characters are often denoted with the quotation marks around them.</li>
<li>
<em>Vectors</em>: a series of values. These are created using the <code>c()</code> function, where <code>c()</code> stands for “combine” or “concatenate.” For example, <code>c(6, 11, 13, 31, 90, 92)</code> creates a six element series of positive integer values.</li>
<li>
<em>Factors</em>: <em>categorical data</em> are commonly represented in R as factors. Categorical data can also be represented as <em>strings</em>. We’ll study this difference as we progress through the book.</li>
<li>
<em>Data frames</em>: rectangular spreadsheets. They are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to <em>observations</em> and the columns correspond to <em>variables</em> that describe the observations. Modern data frames are called <em>tibbles</em>.<br>
</li>
<li>
<em>Conditionals</em>:
<ul>
<li>Testing for equality in R using <code>==</code> (and not <code>=</code>, which is typically used for assignment). For example, <code>2 + 1 == 3</code> compares <code>2 + 1</code> to <code>3</code> and is correct R code, while <code>2 + 1 = 3</code> will return an error.</li>
<li>Boolean algebra: <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> statements and mathematical operators such as <code>&lt;</code> (less than), <code>&lt;=</code> (less than or equal), and <code>!=</code> (not equal to). For example, <code>4 + 2 &gt;= 3</code> will return <code>TRUE</code>, but <code>3 + 5 &lt;= 1</code> will return <code>FALSE</code>.</li>
<li>Testing for inclusion with the <code>%in%</code> operator. For example, <code>"B" %in% c("A", "B")</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> while <code>"C" %in% c("A", "B")</code> returns <code>FALSE</code>.</li>
<li>Logical operators: <code>&amp;</code> representing “and” as well as <code>|</code> representing “or.” For example, <code>(2 + 1 == 3) &amp; (2 + 1 == 4)</code> returns <code>FALSE</code> since both clauses are not <code>TRUE</code> (only the first clause is <code>TRUE</code>). On the other hand, <code>(2 + 1 == 3) | (2 + 1 == 4)</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> since at least one of the two clauses is <code>TRUE</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>Functions</em>, also called <em>commands</em>: perform tasks in R. They take in inputs called <em>arguments</em> and return outputs. You can either manually specify a function’s arguments or use the function’s <em>default values</em>.
<ul>
<li>For example, the function <code>seq()</code> in R generates a sequence of numbers. If you just run <code>seq()</code> it will return the value 1. That doesn’t seem very useful! This is because the default arguments are set as <code>seq(from = 1, to = 1)</code>. Thus, if you don’t pass in different values for <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> to change this behavior, R just assumes all you want is the number 1. You can change the argument values by updating the values after the <code>=</code> sign. If we try out <code>seq(from = 2, to = 5)</code> we get the result <code>2 3 4 5</code>, as we would expect.</li>
<li>We’ll work with functions a lot throughout this book and you’ll get lots of practice in understanding their behaviors. To further assist you in understanding when a function is mentioned in the book, we’ll also include the <code>()</code> after them as we did with <code>seq()</code> above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>Help files</em>: provide documentation for various functions and datasets. You can bring up help files by adding a <code>?</code> before the name of a function or data frame and then run this in the console. You will then be presented with a page showing the corresponding documentation if it exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is by no means an exhaustive list of all the programming concepts and terminology needed to become a savvy R user; such a list would be so large it wouldn’t be very useful, especially for novices. Rather, we feel this is a minimal list of programming concepts and terminology you need to know before getting started. We feel that you can learn the rest as you go. Remember that your mastery of all of these concepts and terminology will build as you practice.

<div id="errors-warnings-and-messages" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Errors, warnings, and messages</h3>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>One thing that intimidates new R and RStudio users is how it reports <em>errors</em>, <em>warnings</em>, and <em>messages</em>. R reports errors, warnings, and messages in a glaring red font, which makes it seem like it is scolding you. However, seeing red text in the console is not always bad.</p>
<p>R will show red text in the console pane in three different situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Errors</strong>: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and will try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. For example, if you see <code>Error in ggplot(...) : could not find function "ggplot"</code>, it means that the <code>ggplot()</code> function is not accessible because the package that contains the function, <strong>ggplot2</strong>, was not loaded with <code>library(ggplot2)</code>. You cannot use the <code>ggplot()</code> function without the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package being loaded first.</li>
<li>
<strong>Warnings</strong>: When the red text is a warning, it will be prefaced with “Warning:” and R will try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. If you create a scatterplot based on a dataset where two of the rows of data have missing entries, you will see this warning: <code>Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point)</code>. R will still produce the scatterplot with all the remaining non-missing values, but it is warning you that two of the points aren’t there.</li>
<li>
<strong>Messages</strong>: When the red text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning”, it’s <em>just a friendly message</em>. You’ll see these messages when you load <em>R packages</em> or when you read data saved in spreadsheet files with the <code>read_csv()</code> function as you’ll see in Chapter 2. These are helpful diagnostic messages. They don’t stop your code from working. Additionally, you’ll see these messages when you install packages too using <code>install.packages()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, when you see red text in the console, <em>don’t panic</em>. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Rather:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the text starts with “Error”, figure out what’s causing it. <span style="color:red">Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong!</span>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> What are R packages?</h2>
<p>Another point of confusion with many new R users is the idea of an R package. R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet.</p>
<p>For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package for data visualization and the <strong>dplyr</strong> package for data wrangling.</p>

</p>
<p>R is like a new mobile phone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play.</p>
<p>Let’s continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a photo you have just taken with friends on Instagram. You need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Install the app</em>: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you’re set for the time being. You might need to do this again in the future when there is an update to the app.</li>
<li>
<em>Open the app</em>: After you’ve installed Instagram, you need to open it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:</p>

<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Install the package</em>: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you’ve installed a package, you likely won’t install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version.</li>
<li>
<em>“Load” the package</em>: “Loading” a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not “loaded” by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to “load” each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s perform these two steps for the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package for data visualization.</p>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<div id="package-installation" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Package installation</h3>
<p>Let’s install the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package. Type <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code> in the console pane of RStudio and pressing Return/Enter on your keyboard. Note you must include the quotation marks around the name of the package.</p>
</div>
<div id="package-loading" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Package loading</h3>
<p>Recall that after you’ve installed a package, you need to “load it.” In other words, you need to “open it.” We do this by using the <code>library()</code> command.</p>
<p>For example, to load the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package, run the following code in the console pane. What do we mean by “run the following code”? Either type or copy-and-paste the following code into the console pane and then hit the Enter key.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb1-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(ggplot2)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If after running the earlier code, a blinking cursor returns next to the <code>&gt;</code> “prompt” sign, it means you were successful and the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package is now loaded and ready to use. If, however, you get a red “error message” that reads <code>...</code></p>
<pre><code>Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’</code></pre>
<p><code>...</code> it means that you didn’t successfully install it. This is an example of an “error message”. If you get this error message, go back to the subsection on R package installation and make sure to install the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package before proceeding.</p>
</div>
<div id="package-use" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Package use</h3>
<p>One very common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is they forget to “load” them first by using the <code>library()</code> command we just saw. Remember: <em>you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.</em> If you don’t first “load” a package, but attempt to use one of its features, you’ll see an error message similar to:</p>
<pre><code>Error: could not find function</code></pre>
<p>This is a different error message than the one you just saw on a package not having been installed yet. R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been “loaded.” R doesn’t know where to find the function you are using. Almost all new users forget to do this when starting out. However, you’ll remember with practice and after some time it will become second nature for you.

<p>Let’s put everything we’ve learned so far into practice and start exploring some real data! Data comes to us in a variety of formats, from pictures to text to numbers. Throughout this book, we’ll focus on datasets that are saved in “spreadsheet”-type format. This is probably the most common way data are collected and saved in many fields. These “spreadsheet”-type datasets are called <em>data frames</em> in R. We’ll focus on working with data saved as data frames throughout this book.

</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, this output does not allow us to explore the data very well, but it does give a nice preview. Let’s look at some different ways to explore data frames.
<!-- ::: --></p>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
</div>
<div id="exploring-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Exploring data frames</h3>
<p>There are many ways to get a feel for the data contained in a data frame such as <code>trains</code>. We present two functions that take as their “argument” (their input) the data frame in question. We also include a fourth method for exploring one particular column of a data frame:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using the <code>View()</code> function, which brings up RStudio’s built-in data viewer.</li>
<li>Using the <code>glimpse()</code> function, which is included in the <strong>dplyr</strong> package.</li>
<li>Using the <code>$</code> “extraction operator,” which is used to view a single variable/column in a data frame.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. <code>View()</code></strong>:</p>
<p>Run <code>View(trains)</code> in your console in RStudio, either by typing it or cutting-and-pasting it into the console pane. Explore this data frame in the resulting pop up viewer. You should get into the habit of viewing any data frames you encounter. Note the uppercase <code>V</code> in <code>View()</code>. R is case-sensitive, so you’ll get an error message if you run <code>view(trains)</code> instead of <code>View(trains)</code>.</p>
<p>By running <code>View(trains)</code>, we can explore the different <em>variables</em> listed in the columns. Observe that there are many different types of variables. Some of the variables including <code>age</code>, <code>income</code>, <code>att_start</code>, and <code>att_end</code> are what we will call <em>quantitative</em> variables. These variables are numerical in nature. Other variables here, including <code>gender</code>, <code>liberal</code>, <code>party</code>, and <code>treatment</code>, are <em>categorical</em>.</p>
<p>Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the <code>View(trains)</code> output, you will see a column of numbers. These are the row numbers of the dataset. If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row is representing. This will allow you to identify what object is being described in a given row by taking note of the values of the columns in that specific row. This is often called the <em>observational unit</em>. The observational unit in this example is an individual participating in the experiment on the Boston commuter train platform.</p>
<p>You can identify the observational unit by determining what “thing” is being measured or described by each of the variables. We’ll talk more about observational units in a later section on <em>identification</em> and <em>measurement</em> variables.</p>
<p><strong>2. <code>glimpse()</code></strong>:</p>
<p>The second way we’ll cover to explore a data frame is using the <code>glimpse()</code> function included in the <strong>dplyr</strong> package. Thus, you can only use the <code>glimpse()</code> function after you’ve loaded the <strong>dplyr</strong> package by running <code>library(dplyr)</code>. This function provides us with an alternative perspective for exploring a data frame than the <code>View()</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb7-1"></a><span class="kw">glimpse</span>(trains)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Rows: 115
## Columns: 8
## $ gender    &lt;chr&gt; "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Fema…
## $ liberal   &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE…
## $ party     &lt;chr&gt; "Democrat", "Republican", "Democrat", "Democrat", "Democrat…
## $ age       &lt;dbl&gt; 31, 34, 63, 45, 55, 37, 53, 36, 54, 42, 33, 50, 24, 40, 53,…
## $ income    &lt;dbl&gt; 135000, 105000, 135000, 300000, 135000, 87500, 87500, 13500…
## $ att_start &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 9, 3, 11, 8, 13, 13, 10, 12, 9, 10, 11, 13, 6, 8, 13, 7…
## $ treatment &lt;fct&gt; Treated, Treated, Treated, Treated, Control, Treated, Contr…
## $ att_end   &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 10, 5, 11, 5, 13, 13, 11, 12, 10, 9, 9, 13, 7, 8, 13, 8…</code></pre>
<p>Observe that <code>glimpse()</code> will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable name. In addition, the <em>data type</em> of the variable is given immediately after each variable’s name inside <code>&lt; &gt;</code>. Here, <code>dbl</code> refers to “double”, which is computer coding terminology for quantitative/numerical variables. While not a data type in <code>trains</code>, <code>int</code> refers to “integer” and is another data type that also represents quantitative/numerical variables. “Doubles” take up twice the size to store on a computer compared to integers.</p>
<p>In contrast, <code>chr</code> refers to “character”, which is computer terminology for text data. In most forms, text data, such as the <code>gender</code> or <code>party</code> of a person, are categorical variables. The <code>liberal</code> variable is another data type: <code>lgl</code>. These types of variables represent logical data (True/False). Finally, the <code>trains</code> dataset also includes the data type <code>fct</code>. <code>fct</code> refers to “factor” and describes a variable that is nominal, or in this case the <code>treatment</code> variable.</p>
<!-- Might be useful resources, commenting this out for future reference -->
<!-- These types of variables represent date and time combinations. However, we won't work with dates and times in this book; we leave this topic for other data science books like [*Introduction to Data Science* by Tiffany-Anne Timbers, Melissa Lee, and Trevor Campbell](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/) or [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) [@rds2016].  -->
<p><strong>3. <code>$</code> operator</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, the <code>$</code> operator allows us to extract and then explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb9-1"></a>trains<span class="op">$</span>age</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##   [1] 31 34 63 45 55 37 53 36 54 42 33 50 24 40 53 50 33 33 32 57 41 36 43 25 41
##  [26] 33 44 46 41 28 36 37 38 48 20 52 38 45 55 38 45 44 36 29 42 43 54 39 31 50
##  [51] 60 67 54 44 50 20 57 25 60 44 35 54 52 47 60 47 22 56 50 21 29 45 46 42 23
##  [76] 29 60 41 30 61 21 46 53 45 46 63 21 31 35 22 68 27 22 30 59 56 32 35 23 60
## [101] 50 31 43 30 54 52 52 50 37 27 55 42 68 52 50</code></pre>
<p>We used the <code>$</code> operator to extract only the <code>age</code> variable and return it as a vector. We’ll only be occasionally exploring data frames using the <code>$</code> operator, instead favoring the <code>View()</code> and <code>glimpse()</code> functions.

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Identification and measurement variables</h3>
<p>There is a subtle difference between the kinds of variables that you will encounter in data frames. There are <em>identification variables</em> and <em>measurement variables</em>. For example, let’s explore the <code>qscores</code> data frame by showing the output of <code>glimpse(qscores)</code>:</p>

## $ instructor    &lt;chr&gt; "Jesse McCarthy", "Cornel West", "Elizabeth Kai Hinton"…</code></pre>
<p>The variables <code>course_name</code> and <code>course_number</code> are what we will call <em>identification variables</em>, variables that uniquely identify each observational unit. Sometimes a single variable might not be enough to uniquely identify each observational unit: combinations of variables might be needed. In this case, the identification variables uniquely identify Harvard courses. Such variables are mainly used in practice to uniquely identify each row in a data frame. <code>course_number</code> gives the unique course number provided by Harvard for that course, while the <code>course_name</code> variable gives the longer official name of the course. The remaining variables (<code>department</code>, <code>term</code>, <code>enrollment</code>, <code>workload</code>, <code>overall</code>, <code>prof_name</code>) are often called <em>measurement</em> or <em>characteristic</em> variables: variables that describe properties of each observational unit. For example, <code>overall</code> describes the numeric variable representing average of students’ rating of course (1 to 5 scale).

<span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Data Visualization using the ggplot2 Package</h2>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;"><strong>ggplot2</strong> is rooted in the data visualization theory known as <em>the grammar of graphics</em> developed by Leland Wilkinson. Similarly to a linguistic grammar, “the grammar of graphics” defines a set of rules for constructing <em>statistical graphics</em> by combining different types of <em>layers</em>. This grammar has been implemented in a variety of data visualization software platforms like R, but also <a href="https://plot.ly/">Plotly</a> and <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>We begin the development of your data science toolbox with data visualization. By visualizing data, we gain valuable insights we couldn’t initially obtain from just looking at the raw data values. We’ll use the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package, as it provides an easy way to customize your plots.</p>
<p>At their most basic, graphics/plots/charts (we use these terms interchangeably in this book) provide a nice way to explore the patterns in data, such as the presence of <em>outliers</em>, <em>distributions</em> of individual variables, and <em>relationships</em> between groups of variables. Graphics are designed to emphasize the findings and insights you want your audience to understand. This does, however, require a balancing act. On the one hand, you want to highlight as many interesting findings as possible. On the other hand, you don’t want to include so much information that it overwhelms your audience.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">In short, the grammar tells us that:</span>
<span style="display: block;"><strong>A statistical graphic is a <code>mapping</code> of <code>data</code> variables to <code>aes</code>thetic attributes of <code>geom</code>etric objects.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>We can break a graphic into the following three essential components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>data</code>: the dataset containing the variables of interest.</li>
<li>
<code>geom</code>: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars.</li>
<li>
<code>aes</code>: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are <em>mapped</em> to variables in the dataset.</li>
</ol>

<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>These three components are specified in the <code>ggplot()</code> function included in the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package. For the purposes of this book, we’ll always provide the <code>ggplot()</code> function with the following arguments (i.e., inputs) at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data frame where the variables exist: the <code>data</code> argument.</li>
<li>The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the <code>mapping</code> argument which specifies the <code>aes</code>thetic attributes involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>After we’ve specified these components, we then add <em>layers</em> to the plot using the <code>+</code> sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the layer that specifies which type of <code>geom</code>etric object we want the plot to involve: points, lines, bars, and others. Other layers we can add to a plot include the plot title, axes labels, visual themes for the plots, and facets.</p>

##   Country     Continent `Life Expectancy` Population `GDP per Capita`
##   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Afghanistan Asia                   43.8   31889923             975.
## 2 Albania     Europe                 76.4    3600523            5937.
## 3 Algeria     Africa                 72.3   33333216            6223.</code></pre>
<p>Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Country</strong>: Name of country.</li>
<li>
<strong>Continent</strong>: Which of the five continents the country is part of. Note that “Americas” includes countries in both North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded.</li>
<li>
<strong>Life Expectancy</strong>: Life expectancy in years.</li>
<li>
<strong>Population</strong>: Number of people living in the country.</li>
<li>
<strong>GDP per Capita</strong>: Gross domestic product (in US dollars).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now consider the following scatterplot, which plots this for all 142 of the data’s countries.</p>
<!--
Note that R will deal with large numbers using scientific notation.  So in the legend for "Population", 1.25e+09 is 1.25 $\times$ 10^9^ = 1,250,000,000 = 1.25 billion. 
-->
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Let’s view this plot through the grammar of graphics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>data</code> variable <strong>GDP per Capita</strong> gets mapped to the <code>x</code>-position <code>aes</code>thetic  of the points.</li>
<li>The <code>data</code>  variable <strong>Life Expectancy</strong> gets mapped to the <code>y</code>-position <code>aes</code>thetic of the points.</li>
<li>The <code>data</code> variable <strong>Population</strong> gets mapped to the <code>size</code> <code>aes</code>thetic of the points.</li>
<li>The <code>data</code> variable <strong>Continent</strong> gets mapped to the <code>color</code> <code>aes</code>thetic of the points.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll see shortly that <code>data</code> corresponds to the particular data frame where our data is saved and that “data variables” correspond to particular columns in the data frame. Furthermore, the type of <code>geom</code>etric object  considered in this plot are points. That being said, while in this example we are considering points, graphics are not limited to just points. We can also use lines, bars, and other geometric objects.</p>
<p>Let’s summarize the three essential components of a graphic:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 3
##   `data variable` aes   geom 
##   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;
## 1 GDP per Capita  x     point
## 2 Life Expectancy y     point
## 3 Population      size  point
## 4 Continent       color point</code></pre>

<p>This table summarizes the differences among the <code>geom</code>s, or visual marks that represent data points, covered in this chapter. Using them, you’ll be able to visualize the distributions and relationships of variables contained in a wide array of datasets. This will be even more the case as we start to map more variables to more of each <code>geom</code>etric object’s <code>aes</code>thetic attribute options, further unlocking the awesome power of the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package.</p>

<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p><em>Scatterplots</em>, also called <em>bivariate plots</em>, allow you to visualize the <em>relationship</em> between two numerical variables. Specifically, we will visualize the relationship between the following two numerical variables in the <code>flights</code> data frame included in the <code>nycflights13</code> package:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>dep_delay</code>: departure delay on the horizontal “x” axis and</li>
<li>
<code>arr_delay</code>: arrival delay on the vertical “y” axis</li>
</ol>
<p>for Alaska Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2013. This requires paring down the data from all 336,776 flights that left NYC in 2013, to only the 714 <em>Alaska Airlines</em> flights that left NYC in 2013. We do this so our scatterplot will involve a manageable 714 points, and not an overwhelmingly large number like 336,776. To achieve this, we’ll take the <code>flights</code> data frame, filter the rows so that only the 714 rows corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights are kept, and save this in a new data frame called <code>alaska_flights</code> using the <code>&lt;-</code> <em>assignment</em> operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb15-1"></a>alaska_flights &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>

<p>For now, we suggest you don’t worry if you don’t fully understand this code. We’ll see later that this code uses the <strong>dplyr</strong> package for data wrangling to achieve our goal: it takes the <code>flights</code> data frame and <code>filter</code>s it to only return the rows where <code>carrier</code> is equal to <code>"AS"</code>, Alaska Airlines’ carrier code. Testing for equality is specified with <code>==</code> and not <code>=</code>. Convince yourself that this code achieves what it is supposed to by exploring the resulting data frame by running <code>View(alaska_flights)</code>. You’ll see that it has 714 rows, consisting of only 714 Alaska Airlines flights.

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span> Scatterplots via <code>geom_point</code>
</h3>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>Let’s now go over the code that will create the desired scatterplot and break it down piece-by-piece.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb16-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> alaska_flights, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> dep_delay, <span class="dt">y =</span> arr_delay)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb16-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Within the <code>ggplot()</code> function, we specify two of the plot’s components as arguments (i.e., inputs):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>data</code> as the <code>alaska_flights</code> data frame via <code>data = alaska_flights</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>aes</code>thetic <code>mapping</code> by setting <code>mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)</code>. Specifically, the variable <code>dep_delay</code> maps to the <code>x</code> position aesthetic, while the variable <code>arr_delay</code> maps to the <code>y</code> position.</li>
</ol>
<p>We then add a layer to the <code>ggplot()</code> function call using the <code>+</code> sign. The added layer in question specifies the third component: the <code>geom</code>etric object. In this case, the geometric object is set to be points by specifying <code>geom_point()</code>. After running these two lines of code in your console, you’ll notice two outputs: a warning message and the following graphic shown.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Let’s first unpack the graphic. Observe that a <em>positive relationship</em> exists between <code>dep_delay</code> and <code>arr_delay</code>: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase. Observe also the large mass of points clustered near (0, 0), the point indicating flights that neither departed nor arrived late.</p>
<p>Let’s turn our attention to the warning message. R is alerting us to the fact that five rows were ignored due to them being missing. For these 5 rows, either the value for <code>dep_delay</code> or <code>arr_delay</code> or both were missing (recorded in R as <code>NA</code>), and thus these rows were ignored in our plot.</p>
<p>Before we continue, let’s make a few more observations about this code that created the scatterplot. Note that the <code>+</code> sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning. You’ll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning of a line. When adding layers to a plot, you are encouraged to start a new line after the <code>+</code> (by pressing the Return/Enter button on your keyboard) so that the code for each layer is on a new line. As we add more and more layers to plots, you’ll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code.</p>
<p>To stress the importance of adding the layer specifying the <code>geom</code>etric object, consider this figure where no layers are added. Because the <code>geom</code>etric object was not specified, we have a blank plot which is not very useful!</p>

<div id="overplotting" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> Overplotting</h3>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>The large mass of points near (0, 0) in the scatterplot we just plotted can cause some confusion since it is hard to tell the true number of points that are plotted. This is the result of a phenomenon called <em>overplotting</em>. As one may guess, this corresponds to points being plotted on top of each other over and over again. When overplotting occurs, it is difficult to know the number of points being plotted. There are two methods to address the issue of overplotting. Either by</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adjusting the transparency of the points or</li>
<li>Adding a little random “jitter”, or random “nudges”, to each of the points.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Method 1: Changing the transparency</strong></p>
<p>The first way of addressing overplotting is to change the transparency/opacity of the points by setting the <code>alpha</code> argument in <code>geom_point()</code>. We can change the <code>alpha</code> argument to be any value between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, where <code>0</code> sets the points to be 100% transparent and <code>1</code> sets the points to be 100% opaque. By default, <code>alpha</code> is set to <code>1</code>. In other words, if we don’t explicitly set an <code>alpha</code> value, R will use <code>alpha = 1</code>.</p>
<p>Note how the following code is identical to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with <code>alpha = 0.2</code> added to the <code>geom_point()</code> function:</p>

<span id="cb19-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb19-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>(<span class="dt">alpha =</span> <span class="fl">0.2</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The key feature to note in this plot is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. Note furthermore that there is no <code>aes()</code> surrounding <code>alpha = 0.2</code>. This is because we are not mapping a variable to an aesthetic attribute, but rather merely changing the default setting of <code>alpha</code>. In fact, you’ll receive an error if you try to change the second line to read <code>geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2))</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Jittering the points</strong></p>
<p>The second way of addressing overplotting is by <em>jittering</em> all the points. This means giving each point a small “nudge” in a random direction. You can think of “jittering” as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Let’s illustrate using a simple example first. Say we have a data frame with 4 identical rows of x and y values: (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), and (0,0). We present both the regular scatterplot of these 4 points (on the left) and its jittered counterpart (on the right).</p>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>In the left-hand regular scatterplot, observe that the 4 points are superimposed on top of each other. While we know there are 4 values being plotted, this fact might not be apparent to others. In the right-hand jittered scatterplot, it is now plainly evident that this plot involves four points since each point is given a random “nudge.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that jittering is strictly a visualization tool; even after creating a jittered scatterplot, the original values saved in the data frame remain unchanged.</p>
<p>To create a jittered scatterplot, instead of using <code>geom_point()</code>, we use <code>geom_jitter()</code>. Observe how the following code is very similar to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with <code>geom_point()</code> replaced with <code>geom_jitter()</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb20-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> alaska_flights, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> dep_delay, <span class="dt">y =</span> arr_delay)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb20-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_jitter</span>(<span class="dt">width =</span> <span class="dv">30</span>, <span class="dt">height =</span> <span class="dv">30</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>In order to specify how much jitter to add, we adjusted the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> arguments to <code>geom_jitter()</code>. This corresponds to how hard you’d like to shake the plot in horizontal x-axis units and vertical y-axis units, respectively. In this case, both axes are in minutes. How much jitter should we add using the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> arguments? On the one hand, it is important to add just enough jitter to break any overlap in points, but on the other hand, not so much that we completely alter the original pattern in points.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the resulting plot, in this case jittering doesn’t really provide much new insight. In this particular case, it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting <code>alpha</code> proved more effective. When would it be better to use a jittered scatterplot? When would it be better to alter the points’ transparency? There is no single right answer that applies to all situations. You need to make a subjective choice and own that choice. At the very least when confronted with overplotting, however, we suggest you make both types of plots and see which one better emphasizes the point you are trying to make.

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Linegraphs</h2>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>Linegraphs show the relationship between two numerical variables when the variable on the x-axis, also called the <em>explanatory</em> variable, is of a sequential nature. In other words, there is an inherent ordering to the variable.</p>
<p>The most common examples of linegraphs have some notion of time on the x-axis: hours, days, weeks, years, etc. Since time is sequential, we connect consecutive observations of the variable on the y-axis with a line. Linegraphs that have some notion of time on the x-axis are also called <em>time series</em> plots. Let’s illustrate linegraphs using another dataset in the <code>nycflights13</code> package: the <code>weather</code> data frame.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the <code>weather</code> data frame by running <code>View(weather)</code> and <code>glimpse(weather)</code>. Furthermore let’s read the associated help file by running <code>?weather</code> to bring up the help file.</p>
<p>Observe that there is a variable called <code>temp</code> of hourly temperature recordings in Fahrenheit at weather stations near all three major airports in New York City: Newark (<code>origin</code> code <code>EWR</code>), John F. Kennedy International (<code>JFK</code>), and LaGuardia (<code>LGA</code>). However, instead of considering hourly temperatures for all days in 2013 for all three airports, for simplicity let’s only consider hourly temperatures at Newark airport for the first 15 days in January.</p>
<p>Recall in section on scatterplots, we used the <code>filter()</code> function to only choose the subset of rows of <code>flights</code> corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights. We similarly use <code>filter()</code> here, but by using the <code>&amp;</code> operator we only choose the subset of rows of <code>weather</code> where the <code>origin</code> is <code>"EWR"</code>, the <code>month</code> is January, <strong>and</strong> the <code>day</code> is between <code>1</code> and <code>15</code>. Recall we performed a similar task in section on scatterplots when creating the <code>alaska_flights</code> data frame of only Alaska Airlines flights, a topic we’ll explore more in the next chapter on data wrangling.</p>

<p>Let’s create a time series plot of the hourly temperatures saved in the <code>early_january_weather</code> data frame by using <code>geom_line()</code> to create a linegraph, instead of using <code>geom_point()</code> like we used previously to create scatterplots:</p>

<p>Much as with the <code>ggplot()</code> code that created the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights, let’s break down this code piece-by-piece in terms of the grammar of graphics:</p>
<p>Within the <code>ggplot()</code> function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar of graphics as arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>data</code> to be the <code>early_january_weather</code> data frame by setting <code>data = early_january_weather</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>aes</code>thetic <code>mapping</code> by setting <code>mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)</code>. Specifically, the variable <code>time_hour</code> maps to the <code>x</code> position aesthetic, while the variable <code>temp</code> maps to the <code>y</code> position aesthetic.</li>
</ol>
<p>We add a layer to the <code>ggplot()</code> function call using the <code>+</code> sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the <code>geom</code>etric object in question. In this case, the geometric object is a <code>line</code> set by specifying <code>geom_line()</code>.

<div id="histograms" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Histograms</h2>
<!-- ::: {.fullwidth} -->
<p>Let’s consider the <code>temp</code> variable in the <code>weather</code> data frame once again, but unlike with the linegraphs, let’s say we don’t care about its relationship with time, but rather we only care about how the values of <code>temp</code> <em>distribute</em>. In other words:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the smallest and largest values?</li>
<li>What is the “center” or “most typical” value?</li>
<li>How do the values spread out?</li>
<li>What are frequent and infrequent values?</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to visualize this <em>distribution</em> of this single variable <code>temp</code> is to plot them on a horizontal line:</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This gives us a general idea of how the values of <code>temp</code> distribute: observe that temperatures vary from around 11°F (-11°C) up to 100°F (38°C). Furthermore, there appear to be more recorded temperatures between 40°F and 60°F than outside this range. However, because of the high degree of overplotting in the points, it’s hard to get a sense of exactly how many values are between say 50°F and 55°F.</p>
<p>What is commonly produced instead of the horizontal line plot is known as a <em>histogram</em>. A histogram is a plot that visualizes the <em>distribution</em> of a numerical value as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We first cut up the x-axis into a series of <em>bins</em>, where each bin represents a range of values.</li>
<li>For each bin, we count the number of observations that fall in the range corresponding to that bin.</li>
<li>Then for each bin, we draw a bar whose height marks the corresponding count.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s drill-down on an example of a histogram.</p>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Let’s focus only on temperatures between 30°F (-1°C) and 60°F (15°C) for now. Observe that there are three bins of equal width between 30°F and 60°F. Thus we have three bins of width 10°F each: one bin for the 30-40°F range, another bin for the 40-50°F range, and another bin for the 50-60°F range. Since:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The bin for the 30-40°F range has a height of around 5000. In other words, around 5000 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 30°F and 40°F.</li>
<li>The bin for the 40-50°F range has a height of around 4300. In other words, around 4300 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 40°F and 50°F.</li>
<li>The bin for the 50-60°F range has a height of around 3500. In other words, around 3500 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 50°F and 60°F.</li>
</ol>
<p>All nine bins spanning 10°F to 100°F on the x-axis have this interpretation.

<p>Let’s now present the <code>ggplot()</code> code to plot your first histogram! Unlike with scatterplots and linegraphs, there is now only one variable being mapped in <code>aes()</code>: the single numerical variable <code>temp</code>. The y-aesthetic of a histogram, the count of the observations in each bin, gets computed for you automatically. Furthermore, the geometric object layer is now a <code>geom_histogram()</code>. After running the following code to create a histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports, you’ll see the histogram as well as warning messages. We’ll discuss the warning messages first.</p>

<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The first message is telling us that the histogram was constructed using <code>bins = 30</code> for 30 equally spaced bins. This is known in computer programming as a default value; unless you override this default number of bins with a number you specify, R will choose 30 by default. We’ll see in the next section how to change the number of bins to another value than the default.</p>
<p>The second message is telling us something similar to the warning message we received when we ran the code to create a scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights: that because one row has a missing <code>NA</code> value for <code>temp</code>, it was omitted from the histogram. R is just giving us a friendly heads up that this was the case.</p>
<p>Now let’s unpack the resulting histogram. Observe that values less than 25°F as well as values above 80°F are rather rare. However, because of the large number of bins, it’s hard to get a sense for which range of temperatures is spanned by each bin; everything is one giant amorphous blob. So let’s add white vertical borders demarcating the bins by adding a <code>color = "white"</code> argument to <code>geom_histogram()</code> and ignore the warning about setting the number of bins to a better value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb27-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> weather, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> temp)) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p>We now have an easier time associating ranges of temperatures to each of the bins. We can also vary the color of the bars by setting the <code>fill</code> argument. For example, you can set the bin colors to be “blue steel” by setting <code>fill = "steelblue"</code>:</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.9.2</span> Adjusting the bins</h3>
<!-- :::{.fullwidth} -->
<p>Observe in the last histogram we created that in the 50-75°F range there appear to be roughly 8 bins. Thus each bin has width 25 divided by 8, or 3.125°F, which is not a very easily interpretable range to work with. Let’s improve this by adjusting the number of bins in our histogram in one of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>By adjusting the number of bins via the <code>bins</code> argument to <code>geom_histogram()</code>.</li>
<li>By adjusting the width of the bins via the <code>binwidth</code> argument to <code>geom_histogram()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the first method, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to cut the x-axis up in. As mentioned in the previous section, the default number of bins is 30. We can override this default, to say 40 bins, as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb29-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> weather, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> temp)) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p>Using the second method, instead of specifying the number of bins, we specify the width of the bins by using the <code>binwidth</code> argument in the <code>geom_histogram()</code> layer. For example, let’s set the width of each bin to be 10°F.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb30-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> weather, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> temp)) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p>While faceted histograms are one type of visualization used to compare the distribution of a numerical variable split by the values of another variable, another type of visualization that achieves this same goal is a <em>side-by-side boxplot</em>. A boxplot is constructed from the information provided in the <em>five-number summary</em> of a numerical variable.</p>
<p>To keep things simple for now, let’s only consider the 2141 hourly temperature recordings for the month of November, each represented as a jittered point.</p>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>These 2141 observations have the following <em>five-number summary</em>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Minimum: 21°F</li>
<li>First quartile (25th percentile): 36°F</li>
<li>Median (second quartile, 50th percentile): 45°F</li>
<li>Third quartile (75th percentile): 52°F</li>
<li>Maximum: 71°F</li>
</ol>
<p>In the leftmost plot, let’s mark these 5 values with dashed horizontal lines on top of the 2141 points. In the middle plot, let’s add the <em>boxplot</em>. In the rightmost plot, let’s remove the points and the dashed horizontal lines for clarity’s sake.</p>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>What the boxplot does is visually summarize the 2141 points by cutting the 2141 temperature recordings into <em>quartiles</em> at the dashed lines, where each quartile contains roughly 2141 <span class="math inline">\(\div\)</span> 4 <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 535 observations. Thus</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>25% of points fall below the bottom edge of the box, which is the first quartile of 36°F. In other words, 25% of observations were below 36°F.</li>
<li>25% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line, which is the median of 45°F. Thus, 25% of observations were between 36°F and 45°F and 50% of observations were below 45°F.</li>
<li>25% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box, which is the third quartile of 52°F. It follows that 25% of observations were between 45°F and 52°F and 75% of observations were below 52°F.</li>
<li>25% of points fall above the top edge of the box. In other words, 25% of observations were above 52°F.</li>
<li>The middle 50% of points lie within the <em>interquartile range (IQR)</em> between the first and third quartile. Thus, the IQR for this example is 52 - 36 = 16°F. The interquartile range is a measure of a numerical variable’s <em>spread</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, in the rightmost plot, we see the <em>whiskers</em> of the boxplot. The whiskers stick out from either end of the box all the way to the minimum and maximum observed temperatures of 21°F and 71°F, respectively. However, the whiskers don’t always extend to the smallest and largest observed values as they do here. They in fact extend no more than 1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> the interquartile range from either end of the box. In this case of the November temperatures, no more than 1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 16°F = 24°F from either end of the box. Any observed values outside this range get marked with points called <em>outliers</em>, which we’ll see in the next section.

<p>Let’s now create a side-by-side boxplot of hourly temperatures split by the 12 months as we did previously with the faceted histograms. We do this by mapping the <code>month</code> variable to the x-position aesthetic, the <code>temp</code> variable to the y-position aesthetic, and by adding a <code>geom_boxplot()</code> layer:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb31"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb31-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb31-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> weather, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> month, <span class="dt">y =</span> temp)) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).</code></pre>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>Observe that this plot does not provide information about temperature separated by month. The first warning message clues us in as to why. It is telling us that we have a “continuous”, or numerical variable, on the x-position aesthetic. Boxplots, however, require a categorical variable to be mapped to the x-position aesthetic. The second warning message is identical to the warning message when plotting a histogram of hourly temperatures: that one of the values was recorded as <code>NA</code> missing.</p>
<p>We can convert the numerical variable <code>month</code> into a <code>factor</code> categorical variable by using the <code>factor()</code> function. So after applying <code>factor(month)</code>, month goes from having numerical values 1, 2, …, and 12 to having an associated ordering. With this ordering, <code>ggplot()</code> now knows how to work with this variable to produce the needed plot.</p>

<p>The resulting plot shows 12 separate “box and whiskers” plots similar to the rightmost plot of the figure of only November temperatures. Thus the different boxplots are shown “side-by-side.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The “box” portions of the visualization represent the 1st quartile, the median (the 2nd quartile), and the 3rd quartile.</li>
<li>The height of each box (the value of the 3rd quartile minus the value of the 1st quartile) is the interquartile range (IQR). It is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability.</li>
<li>The “whisker” portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and represent points less than the 25th percentile and greater than the 75th percentiles, respectively. They’re set to extend out no more than <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times IQR\)</span> units away from either end of the boxes. We say “no more than” because the ends of the whiskers have to correspond to observed temperatures. The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability.</li>
<li>The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called  <em>outliers</em>. These can be thought of as anomalous (“out-of-the-ordinary”) values.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that the definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more than <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times IQR\)</span> units long for each boxplot. Looking at this side-by-side plot we can see, as expected, that summer months (6 through 8) have higher median temperatures as evidenced by the higher solid lines in the middle of the boxes. We can easily compare temperatures across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the heights of the 12 boxes as quantified by the interquartile ranges are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of temperatures recorded in a given month.</p>

<div id="barplots" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.11</span> Barplots</h2>
<p>Both histograms and boxplots are tools to visualize the distribution of numerical variables. Another commonly desired task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, as we are simply counting different categories within a categorical variable, also known as the <em>levels</em> of the categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts, also known as <em>frequencies</em>, is with barplots (also called barcharts).</p>
<p>One complication, however, is how your data is represented. Is the categorical variable of interest “pre-counted” or not? For example, run the following code that manually creates two data frames representing a collection of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb36-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb36-1"></a>fruits &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">tibble</span>(</span>

<span id="cb36-7"><a href="visualization.html#cb36-7"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We see both the <code>fruits</code> and <code>fruits_counted</code> data frames represent the same collection of fruit. Whereas <code>fruits</code> just lists the fruit individually…</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5 x 1
##   fruit 
##   &lt;chr&gt; 
## 1 apple 
## 2 apple 
## 3 orange
## 4 apple 
## 5 orange</code></pre>
<p>… <code>fruits_counted</code> has a variable <code>count</code> which represent the “pre-counted” values of each fruit.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   fruit  number
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 apple       3
## 2 orange      2</code></pre>
<p>Depending on how your categorical data is represented, you’ll need to add a different <code>geom</code>etric layer type to your <code>ggplot()</code> to create a barplot, as we now explore.</p>
<div id="barplots-via-geom_bar-or-geom_col" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.11.1</span> Barplots via <code>geom_bar</code> or <code>geom_col</code>
</h3>
<p>Let’s generate barplots using these two different representations of the same basket of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. Using the <code>fruits</code> data frame where all 5 fruits are listed individually in 5 rows, we map the <code>fruit</code> variable to the x-position aesthetic and add a <code>geom_bar()</code> layer:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb39-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb39-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> fruits, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> fruit)) <span class="op">+</span></span>
<span id="cb39-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb39-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_bar</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>However, using the <code>fruits_counted</code> data frame where the fruits have been “pre-counted”, we once again map the <code>fruit</code> variable to the x-position aesthetic, but here we also map the <code>count</code> variable to the y-position aesthetic, and add a <code>geom_col()</code> layer instead.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb40-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb40-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> fruits_counted, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> fruit, <span class="dt">y =</span> number)) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p><img src="_book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>Compare these barplots. They are identical because they reflect counts of the same five fruits. However, depending on how our categorical data is represented, either “pre-counted” or not, we must add a different <code>geom</code> layer. When the categorical variable whose distribution you want to visualize</p>
<ul>
<li>Is <em>not</em> pre-counted in your data frame, we use <code>geom_bar()</code>.</li>
<li>Is pre-counted in your data frame, we use <code>geom_col()</code> with the y-position aesthetic mapped to the variable that has the counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s now go back to the <code>flights</code> data frame in the <code>nycflights13</code> package and visualize the distribution of the categorical variable <code>carrier</code>. In other words, let’s visualize the number of domestic flights out of New York City each airline company flew in 2013. Recall from Subsection <a href="#exploredataframes"><strong>??</strong></a> when you first explored the <code>flights</code> data frame, you saw that each row corresponds to a flight. In other words, the <code>flights</code> data frame is more like the <code>fruits</code> data frame than the <code>fruits_counted</code> data frame because the flights have not been pre-counted by <code>carrier</code>. Thus we should use <code>geom_bar()</code> instead of <code>geom_col()</code> to create a barplot. Much like a <code>geom_histogram()</code>, there is only one variable in the <code>aes()</code> aesthetic mapping: the variable <code>carrier</code> gets mapped to the <code>x</code>-position. As a difference though, histograms have bars that touch whereas bar graphs have white space between the bars going from left to right.</p>

<p>Observe that United Airlines (UA), JetBlue Airways (B6), and ExpressJet Airlines (EV) had the most flights depart NYC in 2013. If you don’t know which airlines correspond to which carrier codes, then run <code>View(airlines)</code> to see a directory of airlines. For example, B6 is JetBlue Airways. Alternatively, say you had a data frame where the number of flights for each <code>carrier</code> was pre-counted.</p>
<p>In order to create a barplot visualizing the distribution of the categorical variable <code>carrier</code> in this case, we would now use <code>geom_col()</code> instead of <code>geom_bar()</code>, with an additional <code>y = number</code> in the aesthetic mapping on top of the <code>x = carrier</code>. The resulting barplot would be identical to the previous barplot.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.11.2</span> Must avoid pie charts!</h3>
<p>One of the most common plots used to visualize the distribution of categorical data is the  pie chart. While they may seem harmless enough, pie charts actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well. As Naomi Robbins describes in her book, <em>Creating More Effective Graphs</em> <span class="citation">(Robbins <label for="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">2013<span class="marginnote">Robbins, Naomi. 2013. <em>Creating More Effective Graphs</em>. First. New York, NY: Chart House.</span>)</span>, we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees. In other words, it is difficult for us to determine the relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another.</p>
<p>Let’s examine the same data used in our previous barplot of the number of flights departing NYC by airline in Figure <a href="#fig:flightsbar"><strong>??</strong></a>, but this time we will use a pie chart in Figure <a href="#fig:carrierpie"><strong>??</strong></a>. Try to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much larger is the portion of the pie for ExpressJet Airlines (<code>EV</code>) compared to US Airways (<code>US</code>)?</li>
<li>What is the third largest carrier in terms of departing flights?</li>
<li>How many carriers have fewer flights than United Airlines (<code>UA</code>)?</li>

<p>While it is quite difficult to answer these questions when looking at the pie chart in Figure <a href="#fig:carrierpie"><strong>??</strong></a>, we can much more easily answer these questions using the barchart in Figure <a href="#fig:flightsbar"><strong>??</strong></a>. This is true since barplots present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories can be made with single horizontal lines, whereas pie charts present the information in a way such that comparisons must be made by  comparing angles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.11.3</span> Two categorical variables</h3>
<p>Barplots are a very common way to visualize the frequency of different categories, or levels, of a single categorical variable. Another use of barplots is to visualize the <em>joint</em> distribution of two categorical variables at the same time. Let’s examine the <em>joint</em> distribution of outgoing domestic flights from NYC by <code>carrier</code> as well as <code>origin</code>. In other words, the number of flights for each <code>carrier</code> and <code>origin</code> combination.</p>
<p>For example, the number of WestJet flights from <code>JFK</code>, the number of WestJet flights from <code>LGA</code>, the number of WestJet flights from <code>EWR</code>, the number of American Airlines flights from <code>JFK</code>, and so on. Recall the <code>ggplot()</code> code that created the barplot of <code>carrier</code> frequency in Figure <a href="#fig:flightsbar"><strong>??</strong></a>:</p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:flights-stacked-bar"><strong>??</strong></a> is an example of a  <em>stacked barplot</em>. While simple to make, in certain aspects it is not ideal. For example, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors between the bars, corresponding to comparing the number of flights from each <code>origin</code> airport between the carriers.</p>
<p>Before we continue, let’s address some common points of confusion among new R users. First, the <code>fill</code> aesthetic corresponds to the color used to fill the bars, while the <code>color</code> aesthetic corresponds to the color of the outline of the bars. This is identical to how we added color to our histogram in Subsection <a href="#geomhistogram"><strong>??</strong></a>: we set the outline of the bars to white by setting <code>color = "white"</code> and the colors of the bars to blue steel by setting <code>fill = "steelblue"</code>. Observe in Figure <a href="#fig:flights-stacked-bar-color"><strong>??</strong></a> that mapping <code>origin</code> to <code>color</code> and not <code>fill</code> yields grey bars with different colored outlines.</p>

</div>
<p>Second, note that <code>fill</code> is another aesthetic mapping much like <code>x</code>-position; thus we were careful to include it within the parentheses of the <code>aes()</code> mapping. The following code, where the <code>fill</code> aesthetic is specified outside the <code>aes()</code> mapping will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new <code>ggplot</code> users make:</p>

<p>An alternative to stacked barplots are <em>side-by-side barplots</em>, also known as <em>dodged barplots</em>. The code to create a side-by-side barplot is identical to the code to create a stacked barplot, but with a <code>position = "dodge"</code> argument added to <code>geom_bar()</code>. In other words, we are overriding the default barplot type, which is a <em>stacked</em> barplot, and specifying it to be a side-by-side barplot instead.</p>

<p>Note the width of the bars for <code>AS</code>, <code>F9</code>, <code>FL</code>, <code>HA</code> and <code>YV</code> is different than the others.

<code>facet</code>ing breaks up a plot into several plots split by the values of another variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s briefly introduce a new concept called <em>faceting</em>. Faceting is used when we’d like to split a particular visualization by the values of another variable. This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we were interested in looking at how the histogram of hourly temperature recordings at the three NYC airports we saw in Figure <a href="#fig:histogramexample"><strong>??</strong></a> differed in each month. We could “split” this histogram by the 12 possible months in a given year. In other words, we would plot histograms of <code>temp</code> for each <code>month</code> separately. We do this by adding <code>facet_wrap(~ month)</code> layer. Note the <code>~</code> is a “tilde” and can generally be found on the key next to the “1” key on US keyboards. The tilde is required and you’ll receive the error <code>Error in as.quoted(facets) : object 'month' not found</code> if you don’t include it here.</p>

<p>Let’s go over some important points about specifying the arguments (i.e., inputs) to functions. Run the following two segments of code:</p>

<span id="cb53-9"><a href="visualization.html#cb53-9"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_bar</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll notice that both code segments create the same barplot, even though in the second segment we omitted the <code>data =</code> and <code>mapping =</code> code argument names. This is because the <code>ggplot()</code> function by default assumes that the <code>data</code> argument comes first and the <code>mapping</code> argument comes second.  As long as you specify the data frame in question first and the <code>aes()</code> mapping second, you can omit the explicit statement of the argument names <code>data =</code> and <code>mapping =</code>.</p>
<p>Going forward for the rest of this book, all <code>ggplot()</code> code will be like the second segment: with the <code>data =</code> and <code>mapping =</code> explicit naming of the argument omitted with the default ordering of arguments respected. We’ll do this for brevity’s sake; it’s common to see this style when reviewing other R users’ code.</p>
<p>Data “in the wild” is never ready for visualization. We can’t use all the beautiful plots that we learned in the previous chapter until we have “wrangled” the data into a convenient shape. In this chapter, we’ll introduce a series of functions from the <strong>tidyverse</strong> collection of packages which help with wrangling, and everything else we need to do to work with data. Such functions include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>filter()</code> a data frame’s existing rows to only pick out a subset of them. For example, the <code>alaska_flights</code> data frame.</li>
<li>
<code>select()</code> specific variable columns in a data set. For example, choose the <code>dep_delay</code> and <code>arr_delay</code> variables to more easily view the relationship between the two. Additional functions like <code>slice()</code> can further subset the data.<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>arrange()</code> its rows. For example, sort the rows of <code>weather</code> in ascending or descending order of <code>temp</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>group_by()</code> its rows. In other words, assign different rows to be part of the same <em>group</em>. We can then combine <code>group_by()</code> with <code>summarize()</code> to report summary statistics for each group <em>separately</em>. For example, say you don’t want a single overall average departure delay <code>dep_delay</code> for all three <code>origin</code> airports combined, but rather three separate average departure delays, one computed for each of the three <code>origin</code> airports.</li>
<li>
<code>mutate()</code> its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, convert hourly temperature recordings from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>
<code>join()</code> it with another data frame by matching along a “key” variable. In other words, merge these two data frames together.</li>
<li><code>tail()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how we used <code>computer_code</code> font to describe the actions we want to take on our data frames. This is because the <strong>dplyr</strong> package, one of the packages in the <strong>tidyverse</strong>, has intuitively verb-named functions that are easy to remember.</p>
<p>There is a further benefit to learning to use the <strong>dplyr</strong> package for data wrangling: its similarity to the database querying language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> (pronounced “sequel” or spelled out as “S”, “Q”, “L”). SQL (which stands for “Structured Query Language”) is used to manage large databases quickly and efficiently and is widely used by many institutions with a lot of data. While SQL is a topic left for a book or a course on database management, keep in mind that once you learn <strong>dplyr</strong>, you can learn SQL easily.</p>
<p>Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Review the <code>install.packages()</code> explanation in chapter 1 of this text if unsure.</p>

<div id="the-pipe-operator" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.13.1</span> The pipe operator: <code>%&gt;%</code>
</h3>
<p>Before we start data wrangling, let’s first introduce a nifty tool that gets loaded with the <strong>dplyr</strong> package: the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code>. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in R into a single sequential <em>chain</em> of actions.</p>
<p>Recall from chapter 1 that to add the <code>geom</code> layer to your ggplot you had format your code as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb55-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb55-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> flights, <span class="dt">mapping =</span> <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> carrier, <span class="dt">fill =</span> origin)) <span class="op">+</span></span>
<span id="cb55-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb55-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_bar</span>(<span class="dt">position =</span> <span class="st">"dodge"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Without the <code>+</code> at the end of the first row, your computer would not know to continue onto the second. The same would occur without a pipe operator. For instance, take a look at the following code. You can run it in your own Rstudio console. What happens?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb56-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb56-1"></a>alaska_flights &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights </span>
<span id="cb56-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb56-2"></a>  <span class="kw">filter</span>(carrier <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "AS"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Without the pipe operator, the <code>filter()</code> function cannot work because the computer does not know to use the flights dataset for the operation within the parentheses. This will become clearer with more practice using <strong>dplyr</strong> functions.<br><!-- EF: How do I use the index. It might be nice to define argument within the index --></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb57-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb57-1"></a>alaska_flights &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb57-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb57-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(carrier <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "AS"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result will be the transformed/modified data frame that you want. In our example, we’ll save the result in a new data frame by using the <code>&lt;-</code> assignment operator with the name <code>alaska_flights</code> via <code>alaska_flights &lt;-</code>. Because we assigned this modified data frame to <code>alaska_flights</code>, it is a separate entity from the initial <code>flights</code> data frame. If, however, we had written the code as <code>flights &lt;- flights</code> you would have overwritten the previous data frame, and the original <code>flights</code> data from the **nycflights13* package would have to be re-installed to access it again.</p>
<p>Much like when adding layers to a <code>ggplot()</code> using the <code>+</code> sign, you form a single <em>chain</em> of data wrangling operations by combining verb-named functions into a single sequence using the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code>. Furthermore, much like how the <code>+</code> sign has to come at the end of lines when constructing plots, the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code> has to come at the end of lines as well. Note also that the pipe operator can be used multiple times sequentially. Simply include it at the end of your line, and the following function will be immediately linked to the output of the previous line containing the operator. We call the text within the parentheses the argument(s) of a function.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that most <strong>dplyr</strong> verbs, as well as most functions in the larger <strong>tidyverse</strong>, achieve this effect by always having their first argument be an input tibble. For example, look at <code>?dplyr::filter</code> to see that, for example, the first argument of <code>filter()</code> is a tibble named <code>.data</code>. So, we can rewrite the above code snippet as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb58-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb58-1"></a>alaska_flights &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb58-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb58-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(<span class="dt">.data =</span> ., carrier <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "AS"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The “.” serves as special role when using pipes. It represents the tibble which was “passed down” from the previous step in the pipe. Here, we are telling R that “.” — which is <code>flights</code> in this case — is the first argument to <code>filter()</code>. Since argument names do not have to be used, we can rewrite this as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb59-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb59-1"></a>alaska_flights &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb59-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb59-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(., carrier <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "AS"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will almost never write code that looks like this, at least with simple <strong>dplyr</strong> verbs like <code>filter()</code>. But, behind the scenes, this is what is going on. And, in more advanced cases, we will need to use “.” to refer to the passed-in tibble.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there are many more advanced data wrangling functions than just the six listed in the introduction to this chapter; you’ll see some examples of these in Section <a href="#other-verbs"><strong>??</strong></a>. However, just with these six verb-named functions you’ll be able to perform a broad array of data wrangling tasks for the rest of this book.</p>

</div>
<p>The  <code>filter()</code> function here works much like the “Filter” option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variable in your dataset and then filters out only the rows that match that criteria.</p>
<p>We begin by focusing only on flights from New York City to Portland, Oregon. The <code>dest</code> destination code (or airport code) for Portland, Oregon is <code>"PDX"</code>. Run the following and look at the results in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer to ensure that only flights heading to Portland are chosen here:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb60-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb60-1"></a>portland_flights &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb60-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb60-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "PDX"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb60-3"><a href="visualization.html#cb60-3"></a><span class="kw">View</span>(portland_flights)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note the order of the code. First, take the <code>flights</code> data frame <code>flights</code> <em>then</em> <code>filter()</code> the data frame so that only those where the <code>dest</code> equals <code>"PDX"</code> are included. We test for equality using the double equal sign  <code>==</code> and not a single equal sign <code>=</code>. In other words <code>filter(dest = "PDX")</code> will yield an error. This is a convention across many programming languages. If you are new to coding, you’ll probably forget to use the double equal sign <code>==</code> a few times before you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>You can use other operators  beyond just the <code>==</code> operator that tests for equality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>&gt;</code> corresponds to “greater than”</li>
<li>
<code>&lt;</code> corresponds to “less than”</li>
<li>
<code>&gt;=</code> corresponds to “greater than or equal to”</li>
<li>
<code>&lt;=</code> corresponds to “less than or equal to”</li>
<li>
<code>!=</code> corresponds to “not equal to.” The <code>!</code> is used in many programming languages to indicate “not.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, you can combine multiple criteria using operators that make comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>|</code> corresponds to “or”</li>
<li>
<code>&amp;</code> corresponds to “and”</li>
</ul>
<p>To see many of these in action, let’s filter <code>flights</code> for all rows that departed from JFK <em>and</em> were heading to Burlington, Vermont (<code>"BTV"</code>) or Seattle, Washington (<code>"SEA"</code>) <em>and</em> departed in the months of October, November, or December. Run the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb61"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb61-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb61-1"></a>btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb61-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb61-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(origin <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "JFK"</span> <span class="op">&amp;</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb61-3"><a href="visualization.html#cb61-3"></a><span class="st">           </span>(dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "SEA"</span>) <span class="op">&amp;</span><span class="st"> </span></span>

<span id="cb61-5"><a href="visualization.html#cb61-5"></a><span class="kw">View</span>(btv_sea_flights_fall)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that even though colloquially speaking one might say “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont <em>and</em> Seattle, Washington,” in terms of computer operations, we really mean “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont <em>or</em> leaving Seattle, Washington.” For a given row in the data, <code>dest</code> can be <code>"BTV"</code>, or <code>"SEA"</code>, or something else, but not both <code>"BTV"</code> and <code>"SEA"</code> at the same time. Furthermore, note the careful use of parentheses around <code>dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA"</code>.</p>
<p>We can often skip the use of <code>&amp;</code> and just separate our conditions with a comma. The previous code will return the identical output <code>btv_sea_flights_fall</code> as the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb62"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb62-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb62-1"></a>btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>

<span id="cb62-5"><a href="visualization.html#cb62-5"></a><span class="kw">View</span>(btv_sea_flights_fall)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s present another example that uses the  <code>!</code> “not” operator to pick rows that <em>don’t</em> match a criteria. As mentioned earlier, the <code>!</code> can be read as “not.” Here we are filtering rows corresponding to flights that didn’t go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb63"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb63-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb63-1"></a>not_BTV_SEA &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb63-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb63-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(<span class="op">!</span>(dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "SEA"</span>))</span>
<span id="cb63-3"><a href="visualization.html#cb63-3"></a><span class="kw">View</span>(not_BTV_SEA)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, note the careful use of parentheses around the <code>(dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA")</code>. If we didn’t use parentheses as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb64-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb64-1"></a>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(<span class="op">!</span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "SEA"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We would be returning all flights not headed to <code>"BTV"</code> <em>or</em> those headed to <code>"SEA"</code>, which is an entirely different resulting data frame.</p>
<p>Now say we have a larger number of airports we want to filter for, say <code>"SEA"</code>, <code>"SFO"</code>, <code>"PDX"</code>, <code>"BTV"</code>, and <code>"BDL"</code>. We could continue to use the <code>|</code> (<em>or</em>)  operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb65-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb65-1"></a>many_airports &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb65-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb65-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "SEA"</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "SFO"</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "PDX"</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb65-3"><a href="visualization.html#cb65-3"></a><span class="st">         </span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span>dest <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "BDL"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>but as we progressively include more airports, this will get unwieldy to write. A slightly shorter approach uses the <code>%in%</code>  operator along with the <code>c()</code> function.

<p>What this code is doing is filtering <code>flights</code> for all flights where <code>dest</code> is in the vector of airports <code>c("BTV", "SEA", "PDX", "SFO", "BDL")</code>. Both outputs of <code>many_airports</code> are the same, but as you can see the latter takes much less energy to code. The <code>%in%</code> operator is useful for looking for matches commonly in one vector/variable compared to another.</p>
<p>As a final note, we recommend that <code>filter()</code> should often be among the first verbs you consider applying to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about, or put differently, it narrows down the scope of your data frame to just the observations you care about.</p>

</div>
<p>Using the <code>filter()</code> function we were able to pick out specific rows from the dataset. The  <code>select()</code> function allows R users to pick specific columns/variables instead.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the <code>flights</code> data frame in the <code>nycflights13</code> package contains 19 different variables. You can identify the names of these 19 variables by running the <code>glimpse()</code> function from the <strong>dplyr</strong> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb67"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb67-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb67-1"></a><span class="kw">glimpse</span>(flights)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, say you only need two of these 19 variables, say <code>carrier</code> and <code>flight</code>. You can <code>select()</code> these two variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb68"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb68-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb68-1"></a>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb68-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb68-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">select</span>(carrier, flight)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function makes it easier to explore large datasets since it allows us to limit the scope to only those variables we care most about. For example, if we <code>select()</code> only a smaller number of variables as is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:selectfig"><strong>??</strong></a>, it will make viewing the dataset in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer more digestible. Using <code>select()</code> can also be useful for creating <strong>ggplot</strong> visualizations when you only need a few variables.</p>
<p>Let’s say instead you want to drop, or de-select, certain variables. For example, consider the variable <code>year</code> in the <code>flights</code> data frame. This variable isn’t quite a “variable” because it is always <code>2013</code> and hence doesn’t change. Say you want to remove this variable from the data frame. We can deselect <code>year</code> by using the <code>-</code> sign:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb69"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb69-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb69-1"></a>flights_no_year &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(<span class="op">-</span>year)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another way of selecting columns/variables is by specifying a range of columns:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb70"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb70-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb70-1"></a>flight_arr_times &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(month<span class="op">:</span>day, arr_time<span class="op">:</span>sched_arr_time)</span>
<span id="cb70-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb70-2"></a>flight_arr_times</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will <code>select()</code> all columns between <code>month</code> and <code>day</code> (including the two specified columns), as well as between <code>arr_time</code> and <code>sched_arr_time</code>, and drop the rest.</p>
<p>The <code>select()</code> function can also be used to reorder columns when used with the <code>everything()</code> helper function. For example, suppose we want the <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code>, and <code>time_hour</code> variables to appear immediately after the <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>day</code> variables, while not discarding the rest of the variables. In the following code, <code>everything()</code> will pick up all remaining variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb71"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb71-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb71-1"></a>flights_reorder &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb71-2"><a href="visualization.html#cb71-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">select</span>(year, month, day, hour, minute, time_hour, <span class="kw">everything</span>())</span>
<span id="cb71-3"><a href="visualization.html#cb71-3"></a><span class="kw">glimpse</span>(flights_reorder)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Lastly, the helper functions <code>starts_with()</code>, <code>ends_with()</code>, and <code>contains()</code> can be used to select variables/columns that match those conditions. As examples,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb72"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb72-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb72-1"></a>flights <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(<span class="kw">starts_with</span>(<span class="st">"a"</span>))</span>

<p>Unlike <code>filter()</code>, <code>slice()</code> relies on numeric order of the data.</p>
<p><code>pull()</code> grabs out a variable as a vector, rather than leaving it within a tibble, as <code>select()</code> does:</p>

<p>One of the most commonly performed data wrangling tasks is to sort a data frame’s rows in the alphanumeric order of one of the variables. Unlike <code>filter()</code> or <code>select()</code>, <code>arrange()</code> does not remove any rows or columns from the data frame. Instead, the <strong>dplyr</strong> package’s <code>arrange()</code> function  allows us to sort/reorder a data frame’s rows according to the values of the specified variable.</p>

<p>This is, however, the opposite of what we want. The rows are sorted with the flights covering the least distance displayed first.

<p>This code is identical to the previous code that created <code>summary_temp</code>, but with an extra <code>group_by(month)</code> added before the <code>summarize()</code>. Grouping the <code>weather</code> dataset by <code>month</code> and then applying the <code>summarize()</code> functions yields a data frame that displays the mean and standard deviation temperature split by the 12 months of the year.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the  <code>group_by()</code> function doesn’t change data frames by itself. Rather it changes the <em>meta-data</em>, or data about the data, specifically the grouping structure. It is only after we apply the <code>summarize()</code> function that the data frame changes.</p>

<p>Observe that now there is additional meta-data: <code># Groups: origin [3]</code> indicating that the grouping structure meta-data has been set based on the 3 possible levels of the categorical variable <code>origin</code>: <code>"EWR"</code>, <code>"JFK"</code>, and <code>"LGA"</code>. On the other hand, observe that the data has not changed: it is still a table of 336,776 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 19 values.</p>
<p>Only by combining a <code>group_by()</code> with another data wrangling operation, in this case <code>summarize()</code>, will the data actually be transformed.</p>
<p>Let’s revisit the <code>n()</code>  counting summary function we briefly introduced previously. Recall that the <code>n()</code> function counts rows. This is opposed to the <code>sum()</code> summary function that returns the sum of a numerical variable. For example, suppose we’d like to count how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City:</p>

<p>We see that Newark (<code>"EWR"</code>) had the most flights departing in 2013 followed by <code>"JFK"</code> and lastly by LaGuardia (<code>"LGA"</code>).

<p>What happened here is that the second <code>group_by(month)</code> overwrote the grouping structure meta-data of the earlier <code>group_by(origin)</code>, so that in the end we are only grouping by <code>month</code>. The lesson here is if you want to <code>group_by()</code> two or more variables, you should include all the variables at the same time in the same <code>group_by()</code> adding a comma between the variable names.</p>
<!-- EF: perhaps the student should also be encouraged to explore whether or not the order 
of the variables in the group_by are important -->

<p>Another common transformation of data is to create/compute new variables based on existing ones. For example, say you are more comfortable thinking of temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) instead of degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The formula to convert temperatures from °F to °C is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{temp in C} = \frac{\text{temp in F} - 32}{1.8}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can apply this formula to the <code>temp</code> variable using the <code>mutate()</code>  function from the <strong>dplyr</strong> package, which takes existing variables and mutates them to create new ones.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb111"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb111-1"><a href="visualization.html#cb111-1"></a>weather &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>weather <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>

<p>In this code, we <code>mutate()</code> the <code>weather</code> data frame by creating a new variable <code>temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8</code> and then <em>overwrite</em> the original <code>weather</code> data frame. Why did we overwrite the data frame <code>weather</code>, instead of assigning the result to a new data frame like <code>weather_new</code>? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing original information that you might need later, it’s acceptable practice to overwrite existing data frames with updated ones, as we did here. On the other hand, why did we not overwrite the variable <code>temp</code>, but instead created a new variable called <code>temp_in_C</code>? Because if we did this, we would have erased the original information contained in <code>temp</code> of temperatures in Fahrenheit that may still be valuable to us.</p>
<p>Let’s now compute monthly average temperatures in both °F and °C using the <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code> code we saw in Section <a href="#groupby"><strong>??</strong></a>:</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at only the <code>dep_delay</code>, <code>arr_delay</code>, and the resulting <code>gain</code> variables for the first 5 rows in our updated <code>flights</code> data frame in Table <a href="#tab:first-five-flights"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   dep_delay arr_delay  gain
##       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1         2        11    -9
## 2         4        20   -16
## 3         2        33   -31
## 4        -1       -18    17
## 5        -6       -25    19</code></pre>
<p>The flight in the first row departed 2 minutes late but arrived 11 minutes late, so its “gained time in the air” is a loss of 9 minutes, hence its <code>gain</code> is 2 - 11 = -9. On the other hand, the flight in the fourth row departed a minute early (<code>dep_delay</code> of -1) but arrived 18 minutes early (<code>arr_delay</code> of -18), so its “gained time in the air” is <span class="math inline">\(-1 - (-18) = -1 + 18 = 17\)</span> minutes, hence its <code>gain</code> is +17.</p>
<p>Recall from Section <a href="visualization.html#histograms">1.9</a> that since <code>gain</code> is a numerical variable, we can visualize its distribution using a histogram.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.14</span> Data Types</h2>
<p>Recall from Section 3.2 (Basic programming concepts and terminology) we talked about data types including integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, characters, and factors. Let’s recap:
- Integers are values like -1, 0, 2, 4092
- Doubles or numerics are a larger set of values containing both the integers but also fractions and decimal values like -24.932 and 0.8
- Logicals are either TRUE or FALSE
- Characters are text such as “cabbage”, “Hamilton”, “The Wire is the greatest TV show ever”, and “This ramen is delicious.” Note that characters are often denoted with the quotation marks around them.
- Factors are ways of representing categorical data in R</p>
<p>Factors are one of the more confusing data types in R, so let’s learn more about factors and how to use them.</p>
<div id="factors" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.14.1</span> Factors</h3>
<p>We’ve spent a lot of time working with big, beautiful data frames, like the Gapminder data. But we also need to manage the individual variables housed within.</p>
<p>Factors are the variable type that useRs love to hate. It is how we store truly categorical information in R. The values a factor can take on are called the <strong>levels</strong>. For example, the levels of the factor <code>continent</code> in Gapminder are are “Africa”, “Americas”, etc. and this is what’s usually presented to your eyeballs by R. In general, the levels are friendly human-readable character strings, like “male/female” and “control/treated”. But <em>never ever ever</em> forget that, under the hood, R is really storing integer codes 1, 2, 3, etc.</p>
<p>This [Janus][wiki-janus]-like nature of factors means they are rich with booby traps for the unsuspecting but they are a necessary evil. I recommend you learn how to be the boss of your factors. The pros far outweigh the cons. Specifically in modelling and figure-making, factors are anticipated and accommodated by the functions and packages you will want to exploit.</p>
<p><strong>The worst kind of factor is the stealth factor.</strong> The variable that you think of as character, but that is actually a factor (numeric!!). This is a classic R gotcha. Check your variable types explicitly when things seem weird. It happens to the best of us.</p>
<p>Where do stealth factors come from? Base R has a burning desire to turn character information into factor. The happens most commonly at data import via <code>read.table()</code> and friends. But <code>data.frame()</code> and other functions are also eager to convert character to factor. To shut this down, use <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code> in <code>read.table()</code> and <code>data.frame()</code> or – even better – <strong>use the tidyverse</strong>! For data import, use <code>readr::read_csv()</code>, <code>readr::read_tsv()</code>, etc. For data frame creation, use <code>tibble::tibble()</code>. And so on.</p>
<p>Good articles about how the factor fiasco came to be:</p>

<p>[forcats][forcats-web] is a core package in the tidyverse. It is installed via <code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code>, and loaded with <code>library(tidyverse)</code>. You can also install via <code>install.packages("forcats")</code>and load it yourself separately as needed via <code>library(forcats)</code>. Main functions start with <code>fct_</code>.

<p>Example of why we reorder factor levels: often makes plots much better! When a factor is mapped to x or y, it should almost always be reordered by the quantitative variable you are mapping to the other one.
Compare the interpretability of these two plots of life expectancy in Asian countries in 2007. The <em>only difference</em> is the order of the <code>country</code> factor. Which one do you find easier to learn from?</p>

<p>Use <code>fct_reorder2()</code> when you have a line chart of a quantitative x against another quantitative y and your factor provides the color. This way the legend appears in some order as the data! Note, the order is take by the right side of the plot (not the left). Contrast the legend on the left with the one on the right.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.15</span> Importing data</h2>
<p>Up to this point, we’ve almost entirely used data stored inside of an R package. Say instead you have your own data saved on your computer or somewhere online. How can you analyze this data in R? Spreadsheet data is often saved in one of the following three formats:</p>
<p>First, a <em>Comma Separated Values</em> <code>.csv</code> file. You can think of a <code>.csv</code> file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each line in the file corresponds to one row of data/one observation.</li>
<li>Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas in each row.</li>
<li>The first line is often, but not always, a <em>header</em> row indicating the names of the columns/variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, an Excel <code>.xlsx</code> spreadsheet file. This format is based on Microsoft’s proprietary Excel software. As opposed to bare-bones <code>.csv</code> files, <code>.xlsx</code> Excel files contain a lot of meta-data (data about data). Recall we saw a previous example of meta-data in Section <a href="#groupby"><strong>??</strong></a> when adding “group structure” meta-data to a data frame by using the <code>group_by()</code> verb. Some examples of Excel spreadsheet meta-data include the use of bold and italic fonts, colored cells, different column widths, and formula macros.</p>
<p>Third, a <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> file, which is a “cloud” or online-based way to work with a spreadsheet. Google Sheets allows you to download your data in both comma separated values <code>.csv</code> and Excel <code>.xlsx</code> formats. To import Google Sheets data in R use the <a href="https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/"><code>googlesheets4</code></a> package.</p>
<p>Let’s import a Comma Separated Values <code>.csv</code> file that exists on the internet. The <code>.csv</code> file <code>dem_score.csv</code> contains ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992 and is accessible at <a href="https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv" class="uri">https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv</a>. Let’s use the <code>read_csv()</code> function from the <strong>readr</strong>  <span class="citation">(Wickham, Hester, and Francois <label for="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">2018<span class="marginnote">Wickham, Hadley, Jim Hester, and Romain Francois. 2018. <em>Readr: Read Rectangular Text Data</em>. <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr</a>.</span>)</span> package to read it off the web, import it into R, and save it in a data frame called <code>dem_score</code>.</p>

<p>In this <code>dem_score</code> data frame, the minimum value of <code>-10</code> corresponds to a highly autocratic nation, whereas a value of <code>10</code> corresponds to a highly democratic nation. Note also that backticks surround the different variable names. Variable names in R by default are not allowed to start with a number nor include spaces, but we can get around this fact by surrounding the column name with backticks. We’ll revisit the <code>dem_score</code> data frame in a case study in the upcoming Section <a href="#case-study-tidy"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>read_csv()</code> function included in the <strong>readr</strong> package is different than the <code>read.csv()</code> function that comes installed with R. While the difference in the names might seem trivial (an <code>_</code> instead of a <code>.</code>), the <code>read_csv()</code> function is, in our opinion, easier to use since it can more easily read data off the web and generally imports data at a much faster speed. Furthermore, the <code>read_csv()</code> function included in the <strong>readr</strong> saves data frames as <code>tibbles</code> by default.</p>

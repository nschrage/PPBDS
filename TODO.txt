# Summer

## Next Meeting

TW: Better layout, more like R4DS, i.e., shorter individual html pages.

How do we check for math formatting errors, often caused by a $ pair which extends beyond one line?

## TODO

0) How do we find all the broken references? (Bibliography from @kane. Or chapter/figure?)
  + No easy solution. Looks like manual clean-up is the only option.

1) Github Action for PPBDS.data produces weird warning.
  + Fixed. Just had to add rmarkdown as a dependency.

2) Add section to set-up.Rmd to explain (renv::consent()?) how new people need to enable renv for working on the book.
  + Done.

3) Start section with key summary/links associated with things-that-annoy-us-and-we-will-revisit-someday. First item: videos.

4) Better workflow, automatic (with click confirmation) replacement of docs/ after successful check. Two parts: First, change the check so that it builds the book nicely. (Maybe not necessary. Maybe building the book in junk/ is OK?) Second, move the newly created book --- once it is accepted --- to docs/ on the master branch. Should we be taking multiple branches more seriously. Probably.
  + Things to discuss:
    - This change will prevent authors from easily knitting individual chapters. I will explore alternatives.
    - Two ways of handing auto-building and auot-updating:
      - 1) Create a new development branch. Students will submit PR to that branch. When you are ready, you can send a PR to merge to the master
           branch. The changes will only be live when you merge the development branch to the master branch.
      - 2) Keep things as they are. Once a student submits a PR, the build will directly go into docs/ and if successful, you can accept the PR
           and the new changes to the book will immediately be live. If the build check fails, do not accept the PR or else the deployment might
           break.



## DK



Understand bibliography.

 https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2020/04/30/rendering-your-readme-with-github-actions/
 https://github.com/itsyaoyu/github_actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml
 https://www.willandskill.se/en/deleting-your-git-commit-history-without-removing-repo-on-github-bitbucket/

Discuss how to set a stable version of PPBDS.data which we do not touch all semester, and then have a devel branch in which we are fixing all the mistakes.

Explore: bookdown::pdf_book(base_format = msmbstyle::msmb_html_book())

Clean up bok repo to test this:

rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/davidkane9/PPBDS.data.git
git push -u --force origin master

Set up organization for the book.

Add necessary references to the references.bib and ensure that they are called correctly.

## Social Media Plan

1) Students look at three main things when deciding to take a course (sent from one of our new followers on Instagram!):
  - Q Guide scores and reviews
  - The professor (or preceptor!)
  - Anecdotal stoties from friends

2) We need more from you! Pictures and vertical videos for Instagram about your everyday life. Students value the human connection even more in remote learning.

3) We also need more from Gov 50 alumn! I have an interactive story that will go up once we hit 250 followers that alumn will share. We can also create sponsored posts/stories if students are interested. I have already approved my personal account and will post a sponsored post soon.

4) Advertising logistics:
  - We can target 18-22 year-old users associated with Harvard College and living in the US.
  - $25 total, $5/day campaign will have an estimated reach of 2,500-6,600 accounts.
  - Depending on your budget, I suggest we run 2-4 of these campaigns in August.
  - Each campaign will promote one of our best performing posts: I have some appropriate memes scheduled to post soon and Q Guide Score Quotes.

## Book Building

* [*Bookdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) is the key reference. Build the book by following the instructions in _bookdown.yml. Those instructions end with a deployment to Github Pages via the doc/ directory.

* For structure, we decided to have a single _output.yml file, which each chapter must include as so:
---
output_yaml:
  - _output.yml
---

* To ensure that all references appear, make sure the following is added to index.Rmd header:
---
nocite: '@*'
---

* When adding a new package, you must run renv::snapshot() after installing it in the local renv/library directory. This will update renv.lock, I think. But then how are other people supposed to get that update? We need to document how this is working. Don't forget that new contributors need to run renv::consent(), I think.

* We are using the Stanford example.
  + Make sure the **msmbstyle** package is installed
  + `msmbstyle::msmb_html_book` in the _output.yml file outputs to the Stanford format
  + To set the book color to crimson:
    + go to docs/libs/msmb-css-0/msmb.css
    + Find `#1881c2` and replace all with `#c90016`
    + Find `24,129,194` and replce with `201,0,23`
    + Save the file. No need to rebuild the book.


## Things That Annoy Us

These are open projects with annoying details that we will revisit.

* ms-errors and simpsons-paradox. What do we do?

## Open Questions

* Need to start using tidybayes and ggdist. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidybayes/vignettes/tidy-rstanarm.html


* Is there a way to print out messages during the book building process so that you know where the process is? Recall that we can't (?) use R code chunk names because duplicate code chunk names cause (still?) the process to blow up.

* Consider using notes: https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2019/making-tip-boxes-with-bookdown-and-rmarkdown/

* Can you rebuild just a single chapter and then commit/push it? Right now, I have to rebuild the whole thing each time I want to make a single change. Takes too long.



## Other Items


The world confronts us. We must make decisions. The data we want is missing. So, we create models, make estimates, admit to our uncertainty, and then decide.

## Unclassified Items

* Fix "No additional resources" in Chapter 6 and 7. Standardize this section across all chapters. 545 is different. Delete everywhere?

* Take (?) material from: https://chabefer.github.io/STCI/; https://github.com/chabefer/SKY

* Some chapters, like productivity.Rmd have a lot of footnotes. Good or bad?

* Revisit the Prediction Game.

### From the Bookdown book

preview_chapter() and serve_book() as aid to chapter writers.

webshot() tool for including images taken from webpages. Everytime we mention how cool source X is, we should provide a webshot of it. (And we should test that it exists.) Make the productivity chapter include way less of our prose.

switch to tufte() style, ask Healy. Or this guy: http://nickchk.com/chapter5.pdf

Kindle book

put the book on bookdown.org, or class assignments


Key concepts which need to be put everywhere:

decisions need models
potential outcomes and causal effects
units, treatments, outcomes
randomization is magic: assignment to estimate causal effects, bootstrap to estimate uncertainty

Describe, predict, infer. Description of things you can see, prediction for things you will see and inference about things you will never see.

Prediction checks.

Bias/Variance == Underfitting/Overfitting

Drop all the frequentist nonsense except for a footnote at the first use with a confidence interval and an appendix which walks students through the Kuske arguments.


Discuss RCM, assuming that we are estimating a causal effect of some type. And, if we are not estimating causal effects (i.e., all we care about is prediction), then the mechanics of lm are the same, but the interpretation of the regression coefficient has no causal implications.  We want a series of tables illustrating potential outcomes and our estmation of them. Start with a table with ?, just as in the Appendix. We use linear regression to fill in these questions marks. Show table with question marks and then show table with question marks filled in with best guess. Then show table with question marks filled in with a confidence interval for the mean and then for a distribution of predicted values. The closer we can tie RCM to the different parts of a regression, the better. But do this each chapter, not just regression.



Each chapter should finish with a new section which uses list-columns plus broom to estimate scores of models, and then pull out interesting models. See the gapminder examples from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html#gapminder. We need the full tool set: nest, unnest and so on.

Each chapter begins with a real example, a decision we must make (if only the prediction game), and then creates a model which we will use to help us. Bets are always offered. RCM discussed. Bias scenarios demonstrated. The secret weapon --- a model for each state or each year --- used.


## Other summer issues

### Use of Note Boxes

http://statprep.org/

## Other Topics


missing data
regresssion towards the mean
prediction/classification
map/network/text

"docknitr: Use Docker Images to Process Rmarkdown Blocks" looks promising. Note the vignettes. But maybe this is a) overkill and b) only really useful for Python, which is what is used for the docknitr vignette examples. The methods used by STAT 545 and Modern Dive are probably good enough.


# Notes on **bookdown** Book

p. 64 notes that adding the suffix 2 to various output formats gives you all the cool stuff, like figure captioning and numbering.

p. 74 has a useful discussion of configuration options for the _bookdown.yml file.

* rmd_subdir are subdirectories to search for source Rmd files. That seems critical for my submodule structure.

* output_dir is the output directory of the process (_book by default).

* clean is vector of files and directories to be cleaned by the clean_book() function.

pp. 5-6 discuss rmd_files as the way to define your own ordering for output files. This also goes in the _bookdown.yml file.

Probably worth going through the book again in January.


# Appendices

Appendices have information that either a) a prof might reasonably decide not to assign or b) often contain material that students already know.

* Why Bayes?

* Messed up research articles. We need to prepare case studies of messed up articles. Start with those that Gelman cites. The tricky part is trying to figure out how to include these in class. And during which week do we use them.

* Cartoons like [xkcd](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RXKCD)? Others? We should have lots of these, either in an appendix or as margin notes.

* Videos like [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/learnr-videos.html). Use knitr::include_url with embed/id? It is an on-line book, so space is no object! Start by collecting the best work in an appendix.

* All the math you don't need to know. Bayes Theorem. Formulas. Normal distribution. Central limit theorem

* How to Make Tables using gt package, other stuff?

* Tufte and other graphics luminaries

* Leamer and other famous articles

* rtweet (Cassidy)

* Making memes. Someone should figure out which meme maker is best for R. Or maybe we make our own. And then we make lots of memes for the book!

* Map appendix should include some Matt Blackwell examples.

* Entry about best class.

## Things to Think About For Next Summer



Drop bootstrap completely and go straight to Bayesian in chapter 7, but demonstrate the good confidence interval coverage of Bayesian models.

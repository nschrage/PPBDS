<!-- TO-DO: --> 

<!-- 1. Read Chapter 5 and zoom with Vivian about the connection between the two chapters. And don't stop talking until you can explain to her satisfaction what a posterior distribution is, and until she can explain, to your satisfaction, what the bootstrap that you are using in chapter 7 is doing.  You are estimating $\tau$, which is the true mean height of the population. It is a parameter you don't know. Vivian was estimating $p$, the true likelihood of a specific coin coming up heads. It is also a parameter we can't know. She uses data (like 8 heads out of 20), to construct a posterior probability for $p$. You use data (like the height of 2,475 men) to construct a posterior probability for $\tau$. It is the same thing, although your tools, whether bootstrap or lm() are easier to work with than her tools. This is a key connection to make when we are discussing parameter uncertainty. Read the set of notes at the start of chapter 6. Should we create the joint distribution of models and data like we did in chapter 5? How would we? Or is it enough just to claim that this is what lm() does for us? -->




<!-- Remaining Outline of the Chapter -->


<!-- Prove that the bootstrap works, that our 95% confidence intervals provide correct coverage. We make a game and I give you a sample of like 40. Here's the 40, and you give me a 95% CI using the bootstrap tools we learned. Then I give you another 40. And another. If we do this 1,00 times, and we use the same procedure for calculating a confidence interval each time, then 950 should include the truth. That's how we know bootstraps is correct and I could only demonstrate this to you if we know what the truth is.  

Plan: create function called create_ci(), which takes a tibble with a single variable called height and returns the 95% confidence interval --- i.e., a numeric vector of length 2 --- for the 75th percentile.  Note that you get to hard code everything.

Then, create a tibble, first column is ID. Second column is height_sample, which is created by running sample(ch7$height, size = 40, replace = FALSE). Third column is ci, which is result mutate(ci = map(height_sample, ~ create_ci(.)). Fourth column is within_ci, which is TRUE if ci includes the TRUE value and FALSE otherwise. (If you want to have two columns, one for each limit, that is fine.)
-->


<!-- 5. height in the US, using all 2,475 men for 2009. Let's skip the bootstrap here. (We have seen it twice already.) Instead, we just go straight to lm(), tidy() to calculate the mean and its confidence interval. Note that, unlike with 2, we can never know the truth. Then, use this as an example to discuss parameter uncertainty.  -->

<!-- 6. Prediction. What can we use this model for? We think we know p(mean height for 2009), call it p(height). So what? What can we do with this and what do we need to be careful about? This is where we can discuss all our other topics from themes.Rmd. Build a data generating mechanism. With it, we can answer any question we like!  -->


<!-- Turn Standard error method section of coin bootstrap into a four sentence margin note. Show formula. Note that the 95% confidence interval from the bootstrap will generally be the same thing as +/- two times the standard error. But not always! -->


<!-- c) Discuss how this exercise is still useful even if we begin with all our data. That is, don't sample. Just use all 5,000 people. Then, do the bootstrap to get a confidence interval. Note that the interval will be --- how much? --- smaller than the ones we got above, because we are using 116 times as much data. But it is also weird. I know exactly what the mean is! I have the entire Rubin Table! I don't need a confidence interval for the mean.  -->

<!-- d) That is both true, and false. If all you truly care about is the mean these 5,000 people then, it is true, you are done. But that is generally not the case! The true Rubin Table is often bigger than you might initially think. You might also be interested in data from another time period (which has occurred but which may not be available to you) or from 2021, which has not even happened yet. Your Rubin Table includes rows for all those people. They are just missing. You also care about the millions of people who are not in the 5,000. You really want the mean for the country. (Or the world?) So, you use the model that you have to estimate stuff for the data that you don't. What is your best guess for the mean in 2011 (which you can check) or in 2021 (which you can't)? How confident are you are that estimate? What is your 50/50 prediction interval? -->

<!-- e) Relatedly, what if I told you that your 2009 data I gave you did not include one person (or ten people or 100), which was (were) dropped at random from the data by mistake. What is your guess as to the height of that single person, or the height of the average of the 10 people or the tallest of the 10 classes? What is your confidence interval for that? Want to bet? These are all different estimands. -->

<!-- 4) Recall how the probability chapter goes farther than this. It gets all the way to posterior predictions. What will be the mint year of the next penny we get from the bank? What will be the average of the next five pennies we pull? What is a reasonable uncertainty for these forecasts?  Do a posterior predictive checks. Note that we should use all the same "tools" as in that probability chapter. That is, our bootstraps has built a posterior distribution, just like the posterior distribution we built with the coin tosses. Do we then sample from this posterior to answer other questions? Or is that too hard. -->

<!-- 4a) Key issue: How to we transition from this crazy bootstrap approach to using R functions to make the same calculations. Bootstraps take too long, and they are a bother. We need to show how they give the same answer as the built in R functions and then transition away from the bootstrap. Indeed, there is an argument that this chapter (or last chapter?) is the last Bayes Scatterplot we show. That was all about intuition. Once we have that, we can just go to doing things the right way. -->

<!-- 4b) Key issue two: Do we go straight from the bootstrap to rstanarm functions? That would be pretty aggressive. But also pretty cool! Or maybe this chapter we show the bootstrap, the base R (t.test()? lm()?) and rstanarm together. Indeed, the goal for this chapter is to connect them all. Then, next chapter (two parameters) leaves out the bootstrap. And then N parameters drop base functions. But does that really work? Maybe we use base and rstanarm for the rest of the book? Maybe rstanarm only appears in advanced sections. We never use them in this class. Save them for Gov 52? I don't know! -->

<!-- 5) Need to build a Rubin Table. (Read chapter 3 for background and discussion.) We want to have the year for every penny in the world. Sadly, we don't have that! But we do have 50 pennies. Show an RT, which shows both pennies we know the year of and pennies we don't know the year of. If we knew all the pennies, we could just caculate our estimand directly. We would know exactly the mean, the median, the 3rd oldest and so on. No uncertainty. But, we don't have all the years. The question marks mock us! So, we need to infer what is in the missing rows. (And then we . . . not sure I have thought this through.) Also, we can discuss lots of possible biases in the sampling mechanism. Indeed, the sampling mechanism is the key thing to discuss in this section. -->

<!-- 6) We should start the chapter with a decision we face, even a toy one which is not much more than the prediction game. Maybe our friend Joe bets us that a random penny that we get in change from Starbuck's will be older than 1990. Should we take the bet? At what odds? Then, we come back to this at the end and, with the information we have learned, take the bet or not. -->

<!-- 7) Always nice to highlight how flexible the simulation approach is. You might be able to solve the basic problem analytically. But, as soon as some complexity comes in, simulation is your only hope. For example, Joe bets that the second oldest of the four pennies he got in change is older than 1990. Take that bet? Only (?) approach is simulation. Or maybe we should start with a bet which we know can only be solved with simulation. -->


<!-- 2) Get rid of ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_bar). Just use drop_na() and explain what you are doing. -->

<!-- 3) Make our own speadsheet data? Use names from contributors to the book. -->

# One Parameter {#one-parameter}



What is the average height of an American male? What is the 75th percentile of the distribution of height for American men? How certain are you are your estimates? If we past 5 men walking down the street, what are the odds that the tallest will be at least 5 centimeters taller than the shortest?


## Pennies example {#resampling-tactile}

In Chapter \@ref(sampling), we studied sampling. We started with a "tactile" exercise where we wanted to know the proportion of balls in the urn that are red. While we could have performed an exhaustive count, this would have been a tedious process. So instead, we used a shovel to extract a sample of 50 balls and used the resulting proportion that were red as an *estimate*. Furthermore, we made sure to mix the urn's contents before every use of the shovel. Because of the randomness created by the mixing, different uses of the shovel yielded different proportions red and hence different estimates of the proportion of the urn's balls that are red. 

Remember: There is a *truth* here. There is an urn. It has red and white balls in it. An exact, but unknown, number of the balls are red. An exact, but unknown, number of the balls are white. An exact, but unknown, percentage of the balls are red -- defined as the number red divided by the sum of the number red and the number white. Our goal was to estimate that unknown percentage. We wanted to make statements about the world, even if we can never be certain that those statements are *true*. We will never have the time or inclination to actually count all the balls. We use the term *parameter* for things that exist but which are unknown. We use statistics to estimate the true values of parameters.

<!-- Reinforce the last two sentences as the topic sentences for the Remember paragraph. -->


We then mimicked this *physical* sampling exercise with an equivalent *virtual* sampling exercise using the computer. In Subsection \@ref(different-shovels), we repeated this sampling procedure 1,000 times, using three different virtual shovels with 25, 50, and 100 slots. We visualized these three sets of 1,000 estimates in Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3) and saw that as the sample size increased, the variation in the estimates decreased.  We then expanded this for all sample sizes from 1 to 100.

In doing so, we constructed *sampling distributions*. The motivation for taking a 1,000 repeated samples and visualizing the resulting estimates was to study how these estimates varied from one sample to another; in other words, we wanted to study the effect of *sampling variation*. We quantified the variation of these estimates using their standard deviation, which has a special name: the *standard error*. In particular, we saw that as the sample size increased from 1 to 100, the standard error decreased and thus the sampling distributions narrowed. Larger sample sizes led to more *precise* estimates that varied less around the center. 

<!-- Distinguish further the difference between standard deviation and standard error in the above paragraph. Readers can confuse the two. -->


We then tied these sampling exercises to terminology and mathematical notation related to sampling in Subsection \@ref(terminology-and-notation). Our *study population* was the large urn with $N$ = 2,400 balls, while the *population parameter*, the unknown quantity of interest, was the population proportion $p$ of the urn's balls that were red. Since performing a *census* would be expensive in terms of time and energy, we instead extracted a *sample* of size $n$ = 50. The *point estimate*, also known as a *sample statistic*, used to estimate $p$ was the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ of these 50 sampled balls that were red. Furthermore, since the sample was obtained at *random*, it can be considered as *unbiased* and as *representative* of the population. Thus any results based on the sample could be *generalized* to the population. Therefore, the proportion of the shovel's balls that were red was a "good guess" of the proportion of the urn's balls that are red. In other words, we used the sample to draw *inferences* about the population.

However, as described in Section \@ref(sampling-simulation), both the physical and virtual sampling exercises are not what one would do in real life. This was merely an activity used to study the effects of sampling variation. In a real life situation, we would not take 1,000 samples of size $n$, but rather take a *single* representative sample that's as large as possible. Additionally, we knew that the true proportion of the urn's balls that were red was 37.5%. In a real-life situation, we will not know what this value is. Because if we did, then why would we take a sample to estimate it? 

An example of a realistic sampling situation would be a poll, like the [Obama poll](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/04/248793753/poll-support-for-obama-among-young-americans-eroding) you saw in Section \@ref(sampling-case-study). Pollsters did not know the true proportion of *all* young Americans who supported President Obama in 2013, and thus they took a single sample of size $n$ = 2,089 young Americans to estimate this value.

So how does one quantify the effects of sampling variation when you only have a *single sample* to work with? You cannot directly study the effects of sampling variation when you only have one sample. One common method to study this is *bootstrapping resampling*.

What if we would like, not only a single estimate of the unknown population parameter, but also a *range of highly plausible* values? Going back to the Obama poll article, it stated that the pollsters' estimate of the proportion of all young Americans who supported President Obama was 41%. But in addition it stated that the poll's "margin of error was plus or minus 2.1 percentage points." This "plausible range" was [41% - 2.1%, 41% + 2.1%] = [38.9%, 43.1%]. This range of plausible values is what's known as a *confidence interval*, which will be the focus of the later sections of this chapter.

### To the Bank

As we did in Chapter \@ref(sampling), we'll begin with a hands-on tactile activity. We almost always need the **tidyverse** package.

<!-- DK: Why can't we stick a margin note in here about how to install PPBDS.data? I can't even leave a commented out version of the note without crashing any knitting attempt. -->


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(PPBDS.data)
library(rsample)
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

**PPBDS.data** includes the data sets for this book. **rsample** includes functions for bootstrapping, the main statistical tool which will we use in this chapter.

### What is the average year on US pennies in 2019?

Try to imagine all the pennies being used in the United States in 2019. That's a lot of pennies! Now say we're interested in the average year of minting of *all* these pennies. One way to compute this value would be to gather up all pennies being used in the US, record the year, and compute the average. However, this would be near impossible! So instead, let's collect a *sample* of 50 pennies from a local bank in downtown Northampton, Massachusetts, USA as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:resampling-exercise-a).

<!-- CB: I think it would help  with the Preceptor table concept to ask the question of 'If we are given a random penny in 2019, what would we predict the year to be on that penny?' And that way you can tie in and reinforce the idea of the predictive model which is introduced in my chapter like we talked about. Either introduce here or around line 246? -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Collecting a sample of 50 US pennies from a local bank."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("07-one-parameter/images/bank.jpg", "07-one-parameter/images/roll.jpg"))
```

An image of these 50 pennies can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:resampling-exercise-c). For each of the 50 pennies starting in the top left, progressing row-by-row, and ending in the bottom right, note there is an "ID" identification variable printed in black and the year of minting printed in white.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="50 US pennies labelled."}
knitr::include_graphics("07-one-parameter/images/3.jpg")
```

Run the `pennies_sample` code below to extract our 50 sampled pennies.

```{r}

pennies_sample <- tibble(ID = c(1:50), 
                         year = c(2002, 1986, 2017, 1988, 2008, 1983, 2008, 
                                  1996, 2004, 2000, 1994, 1995, 2015, 1978, 
                                  1974, 2015, 2016, 1996, 1983, 1971, 1981, 
                                  1976, 1998, 2017, 1979, 1979, 1993, 2006, 
                                  1988, 1978, 2013, 1976, 1979, 1985, 1985, 
                                  2015, 1962, 1999, 2015, 1990, 1992, 1997, 
                                  2018, 2015, 1997, 2017, 1982, 1988, 2006, 
                                  2017))
pennies_sample

```

The `pennies_sample` data frame has 50 rows corresponding to each penny with two variables. The first variable `ID` corresponds to the ID labels in Figure \@ref(fig:resampling-exercise-c), whereas the second variable `year` corresponds to the year of minting saved as a numeric variable, also known as a double (`dbl`).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Here is my guess for what a Preceptor table would look like in this
# pennies_sample example. I haven't been showing the code for the set up so echo
# = FALSE. Changing the columns to characters for the gt table so that I
# can add the ... row. If you are given random penny X in 2019, what would you
# guess the year to be? The last row is your best guess if you are given that
# random penny. Only have one parameter so only one row to fill in because even
# if you were given 10 random pennies, your best guess for their year is the
# same. That would be different in the two parameter chapter because then you
# could have two rows because you have two parameters.

pennies_sample %>%
  slice(1:7, 50) %>%
  mutate(ID = as.character(ID),
         year = as.character(year)) %>%
  add_row(ID = "...", year = "...", .after  = 7) %>%
  add_row(ID = "X", year = "?") %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(ID = md("**Penny ID**"),
             year = "Year") %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(ID))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(ID))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

Based on these 50 sampled pennies, what can we say about *all* US pennies in 2019? Let's study some properties of our sample by performing an exploratory data analysis. Let's first visualize the distribution of the year of these 50 pennies using our data visualization tools from Chapter \@ref(viz). Since `year` is a numerical variable, we use a histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:pennies-sample-histogram) to visualize its distribution.

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of year on 50 US pennies."}
pennies_sample %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white")
```

Observe a slightly left-skewed distribution, since most pennies fall between 1980 and 2010 with only a few pennies older than 1970. What is the average year for the 50 sampled pennies? Eyeballing the histogram it appears to be around 1990. Let's now compute this value exactly using our data wrangling tools from Chapter \@ref(tidyverse).


```{r}
pennies_sample %>% 
  summarize(mean_year = mean(year))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x_bar <- pennies_sample %>% 
  summarize(mean_year = mean(year)) 
```


Thus, if we're willing to assume that `pennies_sample` is a representative sample from *all* US pennies, a "good guess" of the average year of minting of all US pennies would be `r x_bar %>% dplyr::pull(mean_year) %>% round(2)`. In other words, around `r x_bar %>% pull(mean_year) %>% round()`. This should all start sounding similar to what we did previously in Chapter \@ref(sampling)!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Here I am using the exact same code but adding your good guess value. Any
# random penny you give me in 2019, my best guess would be to say its from the
# year 1995. Basically just filling in the question mark from the original
# Preceptor table.

pennies_sample %>%
  slice(1:7, 50) %>%
  mutate(ID = as.character(ID),
         year = as.character(year)) %>%
  add_row(ID = "...", year = "...", .after  = 7) %>%
  add_row(ID = "X", year = "1995") %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(ID = md("**Penny ID**"),
             year = "Year") %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(ID))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(ID))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

In Chapter \@ref(sampling), our *study population* was the urn of $N$ = 2400 balls. Our *population parameter* was the *population proportion* of these balls that were red, denoted by $p$. In order to estimate $p$, we extracted a sample of 50 balls using the shovel. We then computed the relevant *point estimate*: the *sample proportion* of these 50 balls that were red, denoted mathematically by $\hat{p}$.

Here our population is $N$ = whatever the number of pennies are being used in the US, a value which we don't know and probably never will. The population parameter of interest is now the *population mean* year of all these pennies, a value denoted mathematically by the Greek letter $\mu$ (pronounced "mu"). In order to estimate $\mu$, we went to the bank and obtained a sample of 50 pennies and computed the relevant point estimate: the *sample mean* year of these 50 pennies, denoted mathematically by $\overline{x}$ (pronounced "x-bar"). An alternative and more intuitive notation for the sample mean is $\hat{\mu}$. However, this is unfortunately not as commonly used, so in this book we'll stick with convention and always denote the sample mean as $\overline{x}$.

We summarize the correspondence between the sampling urn exercise in Chapter \@ref(sampling) and our pennies exercise in Table \@ref(tab:table-ch8-b).


```{r, echo=FALSE}

absurd_hack <- tibble(Scenario = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"), 
                      Population_parameter = c("Population Proportion", "Population mean", "Difference in population proportions", "Difference in Pupulation means", "Population regression slope", "Population regression coefficient"),
                      Notation = c("$$p$$", "$$\\mu $$", "$$p_1 - p_2$$", "$$\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$$", "$$\\beta_1$$", "$$\\beta_0$$"), 
                      Point_Estimate = c("Sample Proportion","Sample mean", "Difference in sample proportions", "Difference in sample means", "Fitted regression slope", "Fitted regression intercept"),

absurd_hack

```

Going back to our 50 sampled pennies in Figure \@ref(fig:resampling-exercise-c), the point estimate of interest is the sample mean $\overline{x}$ of `r x_bar %>% pull(mean_year) %>% round(2)`. This quantity is an *estimate* of the population mean year of *all* US pennies $\mu$.

Recall that we also saw in Chapter \@ref(sampling) that such estimates are prone to *sampling variation*. For example, in this particular sample in Figure \@ref(fig:resampling-exercise-c), we observed three pennies with the year 1999. If we sampled another 50 pennies, would we observe exactly three pennies with the year 1999 again? More than likely not. We might observe none, one, two, or maybe even all 50! The same can be said for the other 26 unique years that are represented in our sample of 50 pennies.

So what do we do about this sampling variation? One solution is that we create bootstrap samples! As you already know that resampling is a significant tool in data science, bootstrapping is one such resampling method that many data scientists use today. Bootstrapping essentially repeatedly draws independent samples from our data set with replacement. By sampling with replacement, the same observation can be sampled multiple times and each bootstrap sample will have the same number of observations as the original data set. 

`r margin_note("To conduct bootstraps, make sure your dowload both rsample and tidyverse libraries")`

Before the computer age, scientists would use direct standard error formulas and complex Taylor Series to compute confidence intervals for an estimate. However, the bootstrap was developed as an alternative to compute standard errors and confidence intervals for any statistic in a much faster and easier way. 

The intuition with bootstrapping is that we can model an inference about the population from resampling our sample data and then performing an inference about a sample from each resample. It will look something like this: resampled → sample → population. 

The first thing we want to do when bootstrapping is creating our bootstrap samples.Since we are concerned with the `year` of pennies in 2019, let's select `year` in our data set before we create our bootstraps. Let's now perform the virtual analog for 1000 resamples. Using these results, we'll be able to study the variability in the sample means from 1000 resamples of size 50. Let's first add a `times = 1000` argument to `bootstraps()` \index{rsample!bootstraps()} to indicate we would like 1000 replicates. Remember that we must use the `rsample` library to use bootstraps. 

```{r}
set.seed(9)
virtual_resamples <- pennies_sample %>%
  select(year) %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000)
virtual_resamples
```
So we have now created our bootstrap samples, which are stored in a tibble-like object, and each bootstrap sample is nested in the splits column. This means that each `rsplit` row is a different bootstrap sample and the `id` column is used to identify each bootstrap sample. 

`r margin_note("Check out ?analysis in console to get an even more comprehensive review of what analysis() does")`
Now if you are interested to view a specific bootstrap sample, you can use the `analysis()` function from the `rsample` package, which basically allows you to view a specific bootstrap sample as a data frame. To do so, type `analysis(virtual_resamples$splits[[n]]) %>% as_tibble()` where n represents the nth row bootstrap sample. We will be looking at the first bootstrap sample in this case. 

```{r}
analysis(virtual_resamples$splits[[1]]) %>% as_tibble()
```
As you can see, we were able to view the data in first bootstrap sample. Noticed how it has 50 rows, which is the same as our `pennies_sample`. Now that we know how to create bootstrap samples and view them, we can apply more code to our bootstraps to find our desired statistic, which is the average year of pennies in 2019. 

`r margin_note("In this chapter, bootstrap samples and resamples mean the same thing")`
To compute our desired statistics, we now create the column `boot` by `mutate(boot = map(splits, ~ analysis(.)))`. What we are doing here is that we are iterating an analysis over each bootstrap sample in a new sample. We want to iterate an analysis over each bootstrap sample, because analysis allows us to extract the mean year for each resample. 

```{r}
virtual_resamples <- pennies_sample %>%
  select(year) %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(boot = map(splits, ~ analysis(.)))
virtual_resamples
```

`boot` is now a list-column in the tibble, which we can use if we want to find a specific characteristic of each sample like the average year. Given that `boot` is a list column and we want to pull out the mean year as we are interested in this, we can create two more columns: `years` and year_mean`, respectively.  To create our `years` column, we run `mutate(years = map(boot, ~ pull(., year)))` after creating our `boot` column. What this does is that we are now pulling the year column of each bootstrap sample, which will evidently be nested in a list. Finally, we can create the column `year_mean` to extract the mean of each bootstrap sample by now running `mutate(year_mean = map_dbl(years, ~ mean(.)))`. This command line essentially calculates the mean year from the `years` list nested column. 

```{r}
set.seed(9)
virtual_resamples <- pennies_sample %>%
  select(year) %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(boot = map(splits, ~ analysis(.))) %>%
  mutate(years = map(boot, ~ pull(., year))) %>% 
  mutate(year_mean = map_dbl(years, ~ mean(.)))
virtual_resamples
```

Voila! We were able to create a thousand bootstrap samples and calculate the mean year for each resample. Let's now create a plot to visualizes the posterior distribution for the mean year of American pennies in 2019.

`r margin_note(" In this sense, the bootstrap distribution represents an (approximate)
nonparametric, noninformative posterior distribution for our parameter.
But this bootstrap distribution is obtained painlessly --- without having to
formally specify a prior and without having to sample from the posterior
distribution. Hence we might think of the bootstrap distribution as a “poor
man’s” Bayes posterior. By perturbing the data, the bootstrap approximates
the Bayesian effect of perturbing the parameters, and is typically
much simpler to carry out. --- Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd edition, by Hastie et al, page 271.")`

```{r}
virtual_resamples %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = year_mean, y=..count../sum(..count..)), binwidth = .5, fill = "red") +
    labs(x = "Estimate in Year", y = "Probability",
         title = "Posterior Distribution for the Mean Year of American Pennies in 2019") 
```
Recall from chapter 5 that posterior distribution is based on beliefs and expectations. In the case of the bootstrap samples we made, the posterior distribution represents our knowledge about the mean year of American Pennies in 2019 after taking into account the the data we gathered from our bootstrap sample means. As demonstrated in the plot above, we can see that the mean year of pennies in 2019 is most likely between 1995 and 1998 from our posterior distribution. 


Recall that in the "resampling with replacement" scenario we are illustrating here, this histogram has a special name: the *bootstrap distribution of the sample mean*. Furthermore, recall it is an approximation to the *sampling distribution* of the sample mean, a concept you saw in Chapter \@ref(sampling) on sampling. This distribution allows us to study the effect of sampling variation on our estimates of the true population mean, in this case the true mean year for *all* US pennies. However, unlike in Chapter \@ref(sampling) where we took multiple samples (something one would never do in practice), bootstrap distributions are constructed by taking multiple resamples from a *single* sample: in this case, the 50 original pennies from the bank. 

Congratulations! You've just constructed your first bootstrap distribution! In the next section, you'll see how to use this bootstrap distribution to construct *confidence intervals*.


### Measuring uncertainty with confidence intervals {#ci-build-up}

Let's start this section with an analogy involving fishing. Say you are trying to catch a fish. On the one hand, you could use a spear, while on the other you could use a net. Using the net will probably allow you to catch more fish!

Now think back to our pennies exercise where you are trying to estimate the true population mean year $\mu$ of *all* US pennies. Think of the value of $\mu$ as a fish.

On the one hand, we could use the appropriate *point estimate/sample statistic* to estimate $\mu$, which we saw in Table \@ref(tab:table-ch8-b) is the sample mean $\overline{x}$. Based on our sample of 50 pennies from the bank, the sample mean was `r x_bar %>% pull(mean_year) %>% round(2)`. Think of using this value as "fishing with a spear."

What would "fishing with a net" correspond to? Look at the bootstrap distribution in Figure \@ref(fig:one-thousand-sample-means) once more. Between which two years would you say that "most" sample means lie?  While this question is somewhat subjective, saying that most sample means lie between 1992 and 2000 would not be unreasonable. Think of this interval as the "net."

What we've just illustrated is the concept of a *confidence interval*, which we'll abbreviate with "CI" throughout this book. As opposed to a point estimate/sample statistic that estimates the value of an unknown population parameter with a single value, a *confidence interval* \index{confidence interval} gives what can be interpreted as a range of plausible values. Going back to our analogy, point estimates/sample statistics can be thought of as spears, whereas confidence intervals can be thought of as nets.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Analogy of difference between point estimates and confidence intervals."}
knitr::include_graphics("07-one-parameter/images/point_estimate_vs_conf_int.png")
```

Our proposed interval of 1992 to 2000 was constructed by eye and was thus somewhat subjective. We now introduce two methods for constructing such intervals in a more exact fashion: the *lm method* and the *quantile method*.

Second, they both require you to specify the *confidence level*. Commonly used confidence levels include 90%, 95%, and 99%.  All other things being equal, higher confidence levels correspond to wider confidence intervals, and lower confidence levels correspond to narrower confidence intervals. In this book, we'll be mostly using 95% and hence constructing "95% confidence intervals for $\mu$" for our pennies activity.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Maybe another Preceptor table here with the 90% or 95% confidence interval in
# the last row. Specify that maybe I would answer the question now that if you
# gave me a random penny in 2019, I would be 95% confident its year is somewhere
# between x and x. Change the value for year in the second add_row code line to
# add that confidence interval however you think it best fits in.

pennies_sample %>%
  slice(1:7, 50) %>%
  mutate(ID = as.character(ID),
         year = as.character(year)) %>%
  add_row(ID = "...", year = "...", .after  = 7) %>%
  add_row(ID = "X", year = "1995") %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(ID = md("**Penny ID**"),
             year = "Year") %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(ID))) %>%
  tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(ID))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE)
```

### Confidence Intervals using lm and quantile

Let's now compute the confidence interval for our mean year of pennies in 2019. One way to extract the confidence interval is through using the `lm` method. `lm` means linear model and is generally used in regression modeling; however,`lm` can also used to find the confidence interval for a mean. The catch, though, is that we can only use `lm` to calculate the confidence interval for a mean only! This means that we cannot use `lm` to calculate the condfience interval for a statistic like the median or 75th percentile. 

First, let's type `lm(year ~ 1, data = pennies_sample)` in our code chunk. This alone will get the mean of our dataset for pennies_sample

```{r}
  lm(year ~ 1, data = pennies_sample)
```

So we see that the mean of pennies_sample is 1995. Now let's add the line `tidy(conf,int = TRUE)` to our code. `tidy` is from the `rsample` package and this particular function can get the 95% confidence interval for our mean if we set the argument, `conf.int = TRUE`, in our `tidy` function.

```{r}
  lm(year ~ 1, data = pennies_sample) %>%
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE)
```

 Great! After running the code, we can clearly see the mean of the of `pennies_sample` as well as other characteristics like the upper and lower levels of our confidence interval. Since we are focused on the confidence interval only, let's just `select(conf.low, estimate, conf.high)`.

```{r}
  lm(year ~ 1, data = pennies_sample) %>%
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  select(conf.low, estimate, conf.high)
```

Now we have our confidence interval for the mean year of pennies from 2019, which is (1991.127, 1999.753). But noticed that we used `pennies_sample` and not `virtual_resamples` for the `lm` method to calculate the confidence interval. 

Let's now calculate the confidence interval by hand using our bootstrap samples, `virtual_resamples`. To do, type the following code below:

```{r}
quantile(virtual_resamples$year_mean, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
```

Whoa! Noticed how we got `r quantile(virtual_resamples$year_mean, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))` as our confidence interval, which is the same as the `lm` method using pennies_sample. What this shows is that we can essentially use two methods to calculate the confidence interval for the mean: the `lm` method using the original data set and the quantile method using our bootstrap samples! However, if we want to find the confidence interval for any statistic, not including the mean, we have to use the quantile method using our bootstrap samples!

## EDA for `nhanes`

`r margin_note("Run ?nhanes to get more information about the data from nhanes")`
Let’s perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the nhanes data set from the **PPBDS.data** package. The nhanes data is the data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is about children and adults in America. 

Let’s first load the libraries we will need in this chapter and look at the nhanes data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(PPBDS.data)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(rsample)
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
glimpse(nhanes)
```

`glimpse()` is a really cool function to use to get a peek at your data. It basically allows your data to be viewed running across rows. `glimpse` gives you a sense of what your data is supposed to look like. Based on the glimpse of nhanes, we see that nhanes has data on a diverse array of things like physical attributes, education, and sleep. 

In our examination of nhanes, however, let's restrict the nhanes data to a subset as demonstrated below. 

```{r}
ch7 <- nhanes %>% 
  select(gender, height, survey)
```

Furthermore, it is always smart to look at random samples of our data set.

```{r}
ch7 %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```

Notice how there is a decimal in our ch7 data. this is because `height` is in `<dbl>` and not `<int>`. Explain more!

```{r}
ch7 %>%
  glimpse()
```

Be on the lookout if anything looks suspicious to you. Are there any NA's in your data set? What types of data are the columns, i.e. why is `survey` characterized as integer instead of double? Was most of the data collected in 2009? Are there more females than males? There will clearly be more questions to answer, but it is important that you ask these types of questions and notice anything suspicious. A good data scientist will always look thoroughly at the data. 

```{r}
ch7 %>% 
  skim()
```

Interesting! Noticed how `skim` told us that are 353 missing values of height in our subset of data even though we could not find that out so easily using glimpse. Thus, it's always good to use both `skim` and `glimpse` to get a gyst of what our data entails. 

Since we are dealing with NA's then, let's filter out the NA's using `drop_na`. This we will remove out the rows that have NA's in them.

```{r}
ch7 <- nhanes %>% 
  select(gender, height, survey) %>%
  drop_na()
```

Plot your data.

```{r}
ch7 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height, color = gender)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "Height",
       title = "Height by Gender in Nhanes Dataset")
```
The plot shows some interesting stuff. Since the distributions of height for both genders are skewed left, we can infer that this data set included children and thus age played a role in our data. Additionally, we can see the the most probable heights for both genders and see that men are generally taller than women. 

## Using Bootstraps with `nhanes`

We have shown you how to use bootstrap sampling to create confidence intervals for an unknown parameter for which you have created. In other words, we use bootstrap sampling to create our posterior distribution for the average year of pennies in the US duing 2009. But we have not yet demonstrated that the bootstrap "works." the purpose of this section is to provide that demonstration. 

As we can see that gender and height appears to be related, let's filter our data set to just males and the year 2009 in order to see how we can estimate certain statistics of our further subsetted data set using bootstrap samples. In this example, let's try to estimate the mean 90th percentile of male height in the year 2009. Obviously, we already know what these statistics are since we can easily calculate them by hand. However, the purpose of this example is to show that we can estimate the mean and 90th percentile pretty accurately from our bootstrap samples we will soon create. This section of chapter 7 will essentially show the validity of bootstrap samples. For now, let's focus on subsetting our data even more. 

```{r}
ch7_male <- nhanes %>%
  select(height, gender, survey) %>%
  filter(gender == "Male", survey == 2009) %>% 
  select(height) %>%
  drop_na()
```

By further subsetting our data, we can see that we will only be using one variable. Since we are only estimating a model with one parameter, we can't make use of richer data.

The mean is `r ch7_male %>% pull(height) %>% mean()` and the 90th percentile is `r ch7_male %>% pull(height) %>% quantile(c(.90))`. We are looking at 90th percentile, which is approximately the 237th tallest person. 

We are now going to estimate both of these statistics using bootstrap. Remember how in the `pennies_sample` example, we first used a sample of 50 pennies to create our bootstrap samples. Let's do something very similar. In this case, let's take a sample without replacement of 40 of the 2,370 males in our data and look at their heights in 2009. To do so, we run the following command: 

```{r}
set.seed(9)
heights_sample <- sample_n(ch7_male, 40, replace = FALSE)
```
Great! So now we have our sample of 40 male heights in 2009. Now you might wonder how this section of this chapter is different from the section with `pennies_samples`. Well, there are two key differences. First, we know the truth in this case, so we can examine whether or not the bootstrap works. (That is, we pull a sample of 40 and see if the bootstrap confidence interval from that 40 includes the true 75th percentile of the 2,370) Second, note that only the bootstrap will allow us to estimate statistics other than the mean. We can't use the lm() trick we learned about for pennies as we will find the confidence interval for the 75th percentile, which is a statistic that isn't the mean.

Let's thus create our bootstrap samples. We already know how to create bootsrap samples from the `pennies_sample` section. Let's use the same code but obviously create the variables we are interested in, which are `height_90th`. 

```{r}
set.seed(9)
virtual_heights <- heights_sample %>%
  select(height) %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(boot = map(splits, ~ analysis(.))) %>%
  mutate(heights = map(boot, ~ pull(., height))) %>% 
  mutate(height_90th = map_dbl(heights, ~ quantile(., probs = 0.90))) 
virtual_heights
```

<!-- Bootstrap creates posterior distirbution for your estimate of the unknown parametr: the 75th percentile of heights in the 2370 observations from nhanes -->

DK: Discuss our posterior distribution of the 90th percentile. Why it is weird. Does it include the truth in the 95% interval? Yes!

Cool! We created our bootstrap samples and can see the mean height and 75th percentile of heights for each bootstrap sample. Now that we have our resamples, let's now estimate the mean male height of 2009 and 75th percentile of male height in 2009 using our resamples. We can do the same thing we did in the pennies section by using the `summarize` and `pull` functions. 


## Show Bootstrap Works

Make a function

```{r}
do_the_bootstrap <- function(x){
x %>%   
  select(height) %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(boot = map(splits, ~ analysis(.))) %>%
  mutate(heights = map(boot, ~ pull(., height))) %>% 
  mutate(height_90th = map_dbl(heights, ~ quantile(., probs = 0.90))) %>% 
  pull(height_90th)  %>% 
  quantile(., c(0.025, 0.975))
}
```

```{r}
# sims <- 3
# 
# tibble(ID = 1:sims) %>% 
#   mutate(heights_samples = map(ID, ~ sample_n(ch7_male, 40, replace = FALSE))) %>% 
#   mutate(ci = map(heights_samples, ~ do_the_bootstrap(.))) 
  
```



## Parameter Uncertainty and Unmodeled Variation

Although, we have used bootstrap to predict what we think the mean or a parameter like the median will be, it is important to understand what parameter uncertainty is. Paraameter uncertainty refers to when exact values of parameters are unknown to experimenters and cannot be controlled for. These values usually cannot be inferred by statistical or computational methods. Let's look at the confidence interval of the mean as an example. Based on our bootstrap method, the 95% CI for the mean income is [128999.8, 155201.6]. However, if we take into consideration parameter uncertainty here, we fall under the trap of overconfidence. This is because we do not know for sure the way our confidence interval is elicited is perfectly accurate. We are thus overconfident here when we use a confidence interval. 

Furthermore, it is important that we understand what a residual is. The residual in data science is the error that results. In simple terms, it is the observed value minus the predicted value. So, for example, let's say that the actual mean income is 140,000 but the predicted mean income we got was 130,000. That means the residual in our estimation is 10,000. 

But the reason why residuals are so important is that they help explain why we can't make perfect predictions, especially for an individual. In our experiments, there is a lot of unmodeled variation, or residual variation. Residual variance refers to the variance of residuals, and occurs because randomness in our data is inherently intrinsic. There will be randomness in our data even if we have full knowledge of our data. This thus implies that we cannot really make fully accurate predictions of the future; we can only make probabilistic predictions. It is essentially difficult to control for residual variation: predictions we get from methods like bootstrapping should not be taken as the final consensus. 

I might need to talk more about unmodeled variation here.
reference chapter 5: even if something is fari, we still cant make accurate predictions, only probabilistic predictions.



## Conclusion {#ci-conclusion}

<!-- DK: This section --- and, indeed, the conclusion to each chapter --- are very important. This is a real chance to hit all the highlights. Everything here should be considered fair game for the exam. Indeed, everything here should be covered in the exam. This one is not bad. But it could be cleaned up a bit, with much nicer plots. Maybe a table which directly compares bootstrap and sampling distributions. Need to remind people about why we bootstrap. (We do it because it proves that the lm() simple approaches make sense. It is the justification for our shortcuts. And, indeed, whenever those shortcuts don't work --- which is often! --- a bootstrap still will work.) -->

### Comparing bootstrap and sampling distributions {#bootstrap-vs-sampling}

Let's talk more about the relationship between *sampling distributions* and *bootstrap distributions*.\index{bootstrap!distribution}\index{sampling distributions}

Recall back in Subsection \@ref(shovel-1000-times), we took 1,000 virtual samples from the `urn` using a virtual shovel, computed 1,000 values of the sample proportion red $\hat{p}$, then visualized their distribution in a histogram. Recall that this distribution is called the *sampling distribution of* $\hat{p}$. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution has a special name: the *standard error*.

We also mentioned that this sampling activity does not reflect how sampling is done in real life. Rather, it was an *idealized version* of sampling so that we could study the effects of sampling variation on estimates, like the proportion of the shovel's balls that are red. In real life, however, one would take a single sample that's as large as possible, much like in the Obama poll we saw in Section \@ref(sampling-case-study). But how can we get a sense of the effect of sampling variation on estimates if we only have one sample and thus only one estimate? Don't we need many samples and hence many estimates?

<!-- DK: There is nothing wrong with this text, but I don't like it. We need a more coherent story connecting sampling to the bootstrap. Randomization is magic and these are two forms of randomization. Maybe each chapter after this should mention three types of randomization. These two and then assignment to treatment. Indeed, all of statistics is dealing with situations in which we could not use all three randomization techniques, or approximations thereto. -->

The workaround to having a *single* sample was to perform *bootstrap resampling with replacement* from the single sample. We did this in the resampling activity in Section \@ref(resampling-tactile) where we focused on the mean year of minting of pennies. We used pieces of paper representing the original sample of 50 pennies from the bank and resampled them with replacement from a hat. We had 35 of our friends perform this activity and visualized the resulting 35 sample means $\overline{x}$ in a histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:tactile-resampling-6). 

This distribution was called the *bootstrap distribution* of $\overline{x}$. We stated at the time that the bootstrap distribution is an *approximation* to the sampling distribution of $\overline{x}$ in the sense that both distributions will have a similar shape and similar spread. \index{bootstrap!distribution!approximation of sampling distribution} Thus the *standard error* of the bootstrap distribution can be used as an approximation to the *standard error* of the sampling distribution. 
<!-- DK: The below seems useful, but does it belong in a Conclusion? Probably not. Perhaps each chapter ends with some stats nonsense (like CLT in sampling chapter) before we get to the real conclusion. -->

Let's show you that this is the case by now comparing these two types of distributions. Specifically, we'll compare

1. the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ based on 1,000 virtual samples from the `urn` from Subsection \@ref(shovel-1000-times) to
1. the bootstrap distribution of $\hat{p}$ based on 1,000 virtual resamples with replacement from Ilyas and Yohan's single sample `urn_sample_1`.




#### Bootstrap distribution {-}

Here is the code to construct the bootstrap distribution of $\hat{p}$ based on Ilyas and Yohan's original sample of 50 balls saved in `urn_sample_1`. 

<!-- DK: This is still ugly. Might also be nice to show this exercise with sampling of 100, 1000, 10000 and then 100000, in order to show how things smooth out and look more normal as n increases. -->



#### Comparison {-}




1. To the bootstrap distribution on the bottom: a dashed line at the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ = 21/50 = 0.42 = 42\% that Ilyas and Yohan observed.



Notice that the bootstrap distribution's standard error is a rather good *approximation* to the sampling distribution's standard error. This leads us to our second lesson about bootstrapping:

> Even if the bootstrap distribution might not have the same center as the sampling distribution, it will likely have very similar shape and spread. In other words, bootstrapping will give you a good estimate of the *standard error*. 

Thus, using the fact that the bootstrap distribution and sampling distributions have similar spreads, we can build confidence intervals using bootstrapping as we've done all throughout this chapter!


<!-- ## Rubin Causal Model -->


<!-- At least then we could have an average blood pressure for the respondents in our sample, right? -->

<!-- Not so fast! It is probably not reasonable to assume that every blood pressure measurement is perfectly accurate.  Some survey respondents may misremember or round the values, or use measurements from a doctor's visit long ago.  (How many American adults own blood pressure monitors?)  Furthermore, blood pressure monitors aren't 100% accurate. -->

<!-- One's blood pressure reading also isn't a single, constant number, even if it could be perfectly measured: it depends on the time of day, whether one exercised or ate before taking the measurement, and so on. -->

<!-- So what we really should do is think of each measurement as being drawn from a distribution of potential values for each person; we could construct a *confidence interval* around each of the values to try to reflect these sources of error.  Let's say that a fair CI is 15 points in either direction.  (It may actually be higher; this is just for illustration.)  Then our table really looks something like this: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- # First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table -->

<!-- tibble(subject = c("Respondent 1", "Respondent 2", "Respondent 3", "...", "Respondent 1,000"), -->
<!--        `Blood Pressure` = c("130 (115, 145)", "110 (95, 125)", "115 (100, 130)", "...", "140 (125, 155)")) %>% -->

<!--   # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty -->

<!--   gt() %>% -->
<!--   cols_label(subject = md("**Respondent**")) %>% -->
<!--   tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"), -->
<!--             location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>% -->
<!--   tab_style(cell_text(weight = "bold"), -->
<!--             location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- 1. **Uncertainty in estimating the ATE**.  Even if treatment is randomly assigned, and thus $\widehat{ATE}$ is an unbiased estimate of the true ATE, we still may not have a very *precise* estimate if our sample is small.  With this miniscule sample (five sujects!), the uncertainty might be gigantic, perhaps someting like ($-25$, $13$), which would lead to a prediction for Joe of ($117, 155$).  As we get a larger sample size, this uncertainty decreases.   -->
<!-- 1. **Individual variation**.  Even if we have a perfect estimate of the *average* treatment effect, it still may be the case that the effect *for Joe* is higher or lower than average.  We can assume this away if we say that the treatment effect is a constant $\tau$ for everyone, but that is not likely to be true in the real world --- and this source of uncertainty does not go away simply by collecting more observations.  So with a large sample, let's say that we calculated a confidence interval around $\widehat{ATE}$ of ($-6, -5.67$), leading to an interval for Joe's outcome under control of ($135.67, 136$).  The uncertainty due to individual variation may still be a great deal higher---say ($120, 152$).  These numbers are simply illustrative, but they highlight an important point: even if you have a good estimate of the ATE, you should still be much more uncertain about the causal effect for any *particular individual*. -->

<!-- The main takeaway is that we can get rid of #1 by collecting more data, but the only way to get rid of #2 is through making assumptions, potentially very strong ones. -->

<!-- ## Conclusion -->


<!--
Other stuff which might be added

The kind of computer-based statistical inference we've seen so far has a particular name in the field of statistics: *simulation-based inference*. This is because we are performing statistical inference using computer simulations.\index{simulation-based inference} In our opinion, two large benefits of simulation-based methods over theory-based methods are that (1) they are easier for people new to statistical inference to understand and (2) they also work in situations where theory-based methods and mathematical formulas don't exist.


#### Confidence intervals based on 100 virtual samples {-}

Let's say, however, we repeated this 100 times, not tactilely, but virtually. Let's do this only 100 times instead of 1000 like we did before so that the results can fit on the screen. Again, the steps for compute a 95% confidence interval for $p$ are:

1. Collect a sample of size $n = 50$ as we did in Chapter \@ref(sampling)
1. Compute $\hat{p}$: the sample proportion red of these $n$ = 50 balls
1. Compute the standard error $\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$
1. Compute the margin of error $\text{MoE} = 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} =  1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$
1. Compute both end points of the confidence interval:
    + `lower_ci`: $\hat{p} - \text{MoE} = \hat{p} - 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = \hat{p} - 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$
    + `upper_ci`: $\hat{p} + \text{MoE} = \hat{p} + 1.96 \cdot \text{SE} = \hat{p} +1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$

Run the following three steps, being sure to `View()` the resulting data frame after each step so you can convince yourself of what's going on:



We see that of our 100 confidence intervals based on samples of size $n$ = 50, `sum(virtual_prop_red[["captured"]])` of them captured the true $p = 900/2400$, whereas `100 - sum(virtual_prop_red[["captured"]])` of them missed. As we create more and more confidence intervals based on more and more samples, about 95% of these intervals will capture. In other words, our procedure is "95% reliable."

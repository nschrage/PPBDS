### `group_by` rows

(ref:groupby) Diagram of group_by() and summarize().

```{r groupsummarize, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:groupby)", purl=FALSE, fig.height=2.5}
knitr::include_graphics("01-visualization/images/group_summary.png")
```

Say instead of a single mean temperature for the whole year, you would like 12 mean temperatures, one for each of the 12 months separately. In other words, we would like to compute the mean temperature split by month. We can do this by "grouping" temperature observations by the values of another variable, in this case by the 12 values of the variable `month`. Run the following code:

```{r}
summary_monthly_temp <- weather %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_monthly_temp
```

This code is identical to the previous code that created `summary_temp`, but with an extra `group_by(month)` added before the `summarize()`. Grouping the `weather` dataset by `month` and then applying the `summarize()` functions yields a data frame that displays the mean and standard deviation temperature split by the 12 months of the year.

It is important to note that the \index{dplyr!group\_by()} `group_by()` function doesn't change data frames by itself. Rather it changes the *meta-data*\index{meta-data}, or data about the data, specifically the grouping structure. It is only after we apply the `summarize()` function that the data frame changes. 

Run this code (do not forget to load its package `nycflights13` in your console if you
have not already):

```{r, eval=TRUE}
flights
```

Observe that the first line of the output reads `# A tibble: 336,776 x 19`. This is an example of meta-data, in this case the number of observations/rows and variables/columns in `flights`. The actual data itself are the subsequent table of values. Now let's pipe the `flights` data frame into `group_by(origin)`:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin)
```

Observe that now there is additional meta-data: `# Groups: origin [3]` indicating that the grouping structure meta-data has been set based on the 3 possible levels of the categorical variable `origin`: `"EWR"`, `"JFK"`, and `"LGA"`. On the other hand, observe that the data has not changed: it is still a table of 336,776 $\times$ 19 values.

Only by combining a `group_by()` with another data wrangling operation, in this case `summarize()`, will the data actually be transformed. 

Let's revisit the `n()` \index{dplyr!n()} counting summary function we briefly introduced previously. Recall that the `n()` function counts rows. This is opposed to the `sum()` summary function that returns the sum of a numerical variable. For example, suppose we'd like to count how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
by_origin <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_origin
```

We see that Newark (`"EWR"`) had the most flights departing in 2013 followed by `"JFK"` and lastly by LaGuardia (`"LGA"`). Note there is a subtle but important difference between `sum()` and `n()`; while `sum()` returns the sum of a numerical variable, `n()` returns a count of the number of rows/observations. 

If you would like to remove this grouping structure meta-data, we can pipe the resulting data frame into the \index{dplyr!ungroup()} `ungroup()` function:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Observe how the `# Groups: origin [3]` meta-data is no longer present. 

### Grouping by more than one variable

You are not limited to grouping by one variable. Say you want to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports *for each month*. We can also group by a second variable `month` using `group_by(origin, month)`:

```{r}
by_origin_monthly <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_origin_monthly
```

Observe that there are 36 rows to `by_origin_monthly` because there are 12 months for 3 airports (`EWR`, `JFK`, and `LGA`). 

Why do we `group_by(origin, month)` and not `group_by(origin)` and then `group_by(month)`? Let's investigate:

```{r}
by_origin_monthly_incorrect <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_origin_monthly_incorrect
```

What happened here is that the second `group_by(month)` overwrote the grouping structure meta-data of the earlier `group_by(origin)`, so that in the end we are only grouping by `month`. The lesson here is if you want to `group_by()` two or more variables, you should include all the variables at the same time in the same `group_by()` adding a comma between the variable names.

Recall the `read_csv()` function from chapter 1 of this textbook. In a previous exercise, we ran the following code chunk:
```{r}
library(readr)
dem_score <- read_csv(file = "https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv")
```
The result of this code chunk is pretty tame. It tells us that each comma from the .csv file corresponds to a column, and the column names are taken from the first line of the file. Then, the function "guesses" an appropriate data type for each of the columns it creates. Sometimes .csv files are a lot dirtier and require significant wrangling before you can explore the data and create usable graphics. 

Let's try to run `read_csv()` on another dataset. This is a link to a file containing the faculty's gender data across departments at Harvard University.
```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidkane9/PPBDS/master/02-tidyverse/data/harvard-faculty-gender-final.csv"
gender_data <- read_csv(file = url)
```

Now, call `gender_data`.
```{r}
gender_data
```

As you can see, the second row was likely meant to contain the column names. You can run `?read_csv()` in your console to see the additional arguments that the `read_csv()` function may contain to make the new dataframe easier to work with.

```{r}
gender_data <- read_csv(file = url, skip = 1)
gender_data
```

Now suppose we want to change the data type of one of more of the columns. The `col_type` argument allows us to do this. Without the `col_type` argument, the `division` column is read in as a character column. Instead, we want it to be read in as a factor.  

```{r}
gender_data <- read_csv(file = url, skip = 1, col_type = cols(division = col_factor()))
```

Now that the new dataset has been read in, explore it using the `View()` and `glimpse()` functions and the `$` operator from the previous chapter. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(gender_data)
```

```{r}
glimpse(gender_data)

gender_data$division
```

Run the `summary()` function on the `gender_data` dataframe.
```{r}
summary(gender_data)
```
You may notice that something appears to be wrong with this dataset. Which department could have employed 644 male full professors? Let's explore what is going wrong here. 
```{r}
gender_data %>% filter(full_profs_m == 644)
```

It seems that one row of the table takes the sum of each of the other rows. This is likely the last row of the dataframe. Use `tail()` to print the last rows of the dataframe to check the final row.
```{r}
tail(gender_data)
```

Now, remove the "Total" row because it will affect any dplyr functions we try to run on the dataframe. Check the `tail()` of the dataframe again to make sure that the proper row was removed. 
```{r}
gender_data <- gender_data %>%
  filter(concentration != "Total")

tail(gender_data)
```

## `summarize` variables {#summarize}
<!-- EF: Add across() --> 

The next common task when working with data frames is to compute *summary statistics*. Summary statistics are single numerical values that summarize a large number of values. Commonly known examples of summary statistics include the mean (also called the average) and the median (the middle value). Other examples of summary statistics that might not immediately come to mind include the *sum*, the smallest value also called the *minimum*, the largest value also called the *maximum*, and the *standard deviation*.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Diagram of summarize() rows."}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/summarize1.png")
```

Recall the output of the `summary()` function. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(gender_data)
```

This function offers an array of summary statistics for each of the columns of the dataset, but `summarize()` (or alternatively `summarise()`) allows us to calculate these statistics on individual columns of the dataset. 

Return to a familiar dataset. Let's calculate two summary statistics of the `temp` temperature variable in the `weather` data frame: the mean and standard deviation (recall from Section \@ref(nycflights13) that the `weather` data frame is included in the `nycflights13` package). To compute these summary statistics, we need the `mean()` and `sd()` *summary functions* in R. Summary functions in R take in many values and return a single value.


More precisely, we'll use the `mean()` and `sd()` summary functions within the `summarize()`  function from the **dplyr** package. Note you can also use the British English spelling of `summarise()`. The `summarize()` function takes in a data frame and returns a data frame with only one row corresponding to the summary statistics. 

We'll save the results in a new data frame called `summary_temp` that will have two columns/variables: the `mean` and the `std_dev`:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
summary_temp <- weather %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(temp), std_dev = sd(temp))
summary_temp
```

Why are the values returned `NA`?``NA` is how R encodes *missing values*  where `NA` indicates "not available" or "not applicable." If a value for a particular row and a particular column does not exist, `NA` is stored instead. Values can be missing for many reasons. Perhaps the data was collected but someone forgot to enter it? Perhaps the data was not collected at all because it was too difficult to do so? Perhaps there was an erroneous value that someone entered that has been corrected to read as missing? You'll often encounter issues with missing values when working with real data.

Going back to our `summary_temp` output, by default any time you try to calculate a summary statistic of a variable that has one or more `NA` missing values in R, `NA` is returned. To work around this fact, you can set the `na.rm` argument to `TRUE`, where `rm` is short for "remove"; this will ignore any `NA` missing values and only return the summary value for all non-missing values. 

The code that follows computes the mean and standard deviation of all non-missing values of `temp`:

```{r}
summary_temp <- weather %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_temp
```

Notice how the `na.rm = TRUE` are used as arguments to the `mean()` and `sd()` summary functions individually, and not to the `summarize()` function. 

However, one needs to be cautious whenever ignoring missing values as we've just done. There are possible ramifications of blindly sweeping rows with missing values "under the rug." This is in fact why the `na.rm` argument to any summary statistic function in R is set to `FALSE` by default. In other words, R does not ignore rows with missing values by default. R is alerting you to the presence of missing data and you should be mindful of this missingness and any potential causes of this missingness throughout your analysis.

What are other summary functions we can use inside the `summarize()` verb to compute summary statistics? You ou can use any function in R that takes many values and returns just one. Here are just a few:

* `mean()`: the average
* `sd()`: the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread
* `min()` and `max()`: the minimum and maximum values, respectively
* `IQR()`: interquartile range
* `sum()`: the total amount when adding multiple numbers
* `n()`: a count of the number of rows in each group.

Let's return to the `gain` variable from the previous chapter and look at some summary statistics by considering multiple summary functions at once in the same `summarize()` code:

```{r, include=FALSE}
flights <- flights %>%
  mutate(gain = arr_delay - dep_delay)
```

```{r}
gain_summary <- flights %>% 
  summarize(
    min = min(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    q1 = quantile(gain, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = quantile(gain, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE),
    q3 = quantile(gain, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    missing = sum(is.na(gain))
  )
gain_summary
```

We see for example that the average gain is +5 minutes, while the largest is +109 minutes! However, this code would take some time to type out in practice. 

We can also run summary statistics `across()` multiple columns at the same time. To get a better understanding of the `across()` helper function, run `?across` in your console and see what arguments it takes. Suppose we wanted to take the `mean()` of both the `temp` and the `dewp` variables. 
```{r}
weather %>%
  summarize(across(c(temp, dewp), mean))
```
Again, we encounter `NA` values missing values, and have to set `na.rm = TRUE` as an argument for the `mean()` function. 
<!-- Explain the  ~ and . thoroughly. --> 
```{r}
weather %>%
  summarize(across(c(temp, dewp), ~ mean(., na.rm = TRUE)))
```

```{r}
weather %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

## Character Vectors

We've spent a lot of time working with big, beautiful data frames. That are clean and wholesome, like the Gapminder and nycflights13 data.

But real life will be much nastier. You will bring data into R from the outside world and discover there are problems. You might think: how hard can it be to deal with character data? And the answer is: it can be very hard!

* [Stack Exchange outage][stackexchange-outage]
* [Regexes to validate/match email addresses][email-regex]
* [Fixing an Atom bug][fix-atom-bug]

<!-- EF: Here I might make the distinction between strings and characters a little bit
clearer because that is a pretty important basic CS principle -->

Here we discuss common remedial tasks for cleaning and transforming character data, also known as "strings". A data frame or tibble will consist of one or more *atomic vectors* of a certain class. This lesson deals with things you can do with vectors of class `character`.

Here are some resources:

### Manipulating character vectors

* [stringr package][stringr-web].
  - A core package in the `tidyverse.` It is installed via `install.packages("tidyverse")` and also loaded via `library(tidyverse)`. Of course, you can also install or load it individually.
  - Main functions start with `str_`. Auto-complete is your friend.
  - Replacements for base functions re: string manipulation and regular expressions (see below).
  - Main advantages over base functions: greater consistency about inputs and outputs. Outputs are more ready for your next analytical task. 
* [tidyr package][tidyr-web].
  - Especially useful for functions that split one character vector into many and *vice versa*: `separate()`, `unite()`, `extract()`.
* The [glue package][glue-web] is fantastic for string interpolation. If `stringr::str_interp()` doesn't get your job done, check out the glue package.

### Regular expressions resources

A God-awful and powerful language for expressing patterns to match in text or for search-and-replace. Frequently described as "write only", because regular expressions (or regex) are easier to write than to read/understand. And they are not particularly easy to write.

* We again prefer the [stringr package][stringr-cran] over base functions. Why?
  - Wraps [stringi][stringi-cran], which is a great place to look if stringr isn't powerful enough.
  - Standardized on [ICU regular expressions][icu-regex], so you can stop toggling `perl = TRUE/FALSE` at random.
  - Results come back in a form that is much friendlier for downstream work.
* The [Strings chapter][r4ds-strings] of [R for Data Science][r4ds] [@wickham2016] is a great resource.
* RStudio Cheat Sheet on [Regular Expressions in R][rstudio-regex-cheatsheet].
* Regex testers:
  - [regex101.com][regex101]
  - [regexr.com][regexr]

### Character encoding resources

* [Strings subsection of data import chapter][r4ds-readr-strings] in [R for Data Science][r4ds] [@wickham2016].
* Screeds on the Minimum Everyone Needs to Know about encoding:
  - [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)][unicode-no-excuses]

### Character vectors that live in a data frame
Load the tidyverse, which includes stringr

```{r start_char_vectors}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Regex-free string manipulation with stringr and tidyr

Basic string manipulation tasks:

* Study a single character vector
  - How long are the strings?
  - Presence/absence of a literal string
* Operate on a single character vector
  - Keep/discard elements that contain a literal string
  - Split into two or more character vectors using a fixed delimiter    
  - Snip out pieces of the strings based on character position
  - Collapse into a single string
* Operate on two or more character vectors
  - Glue them together element-wise to get a new character vector.

*`fruit`, `words`, and `sentences` are character vectors that ship with stringr for practicing.*

### Detect or filter on a target string

Determine presence/absence of a literal string with `str_detect()`. Spoiler: later we see `str_detect()` also detects regular expressions.

Which fruits actually use the word "fruit"?

```{r}
str_detect(fruit, pattern = "fruit")
```

What's the easiest way to get the actual fruits that match? Use `str_subset()` to keep only the matching elements. Note we are storing this new vector `my_fruit` to use in later examples!

```{r}
(my_fruit <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "fruit"))
```

### View a specific string

Use `stringr::str_view()` to create a window in your viewer that highlights a specified pattern for any and all instances within the list. Below we look at a subset of fruit and highlight the pattern "berry" within items in that list. 

```{r}
str_view(fruit[5:10], pattern = "berry")
```

This can be helpful when you want to check that you are highlighting the correct pattern (especially when using regex). What do you think the following regex means? (This will be explained in more depth later)

```{r}
str_view(fruit[1:5], pattern = "^a.*o")
```

### String splitting by delimiter

Use `stringr::str_split()` to split strings on a delimiter. Some of our fruits are compound words, like "grapefruit", but some have two words, like "ugli fruit". Here we split on a single space `" "`, but show use of a regular expression later. 

```{r}
str_split(my_fruit, pattern = " ")
```

It's bummer that we get a *list* back. But it must be so! In full generality, split strings must return list, because who knows how many pieces there will be?

If you are willing to commit to the number of pieces, you can use `str_split_fixed()` and get a character matrix. You're welcome!

```{r}
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = " ", n = 2)
```

If the to-be-split variable lives in a data frame, `tidyr::separate()` will split it into 2 or more variables.

```{r}
my_fruit_df <- tibble(my_fruit)
my_fruit_df %>% 
  separate(my_fruit, into = c("pre", "post"), sep = " ")
```

### Substring extraction (and replacement) by position

Count characters in your strings with `str_length()`. Note this is different from the length of the character vector itself.

```{r}
length(my_fruit)
str_length(my_fruit)
```

You can snip out substrings based on character position with `str_sub()`.

```{r}
head(fruit) %>% 
  str_sub(1, 3)
```

The `start` and `end` arguments are vectorised. __Example:__ a sliding 3-character window.

```{r}
tibble(fruit) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  mutate(snip = str_sub(fruit, 1:6, 3:8))
```

Finally, `str_sub()` also works for assignment, i.e. on the left hand side of `<-`.

```{r}
(x <- head(fruit, 3))
str_sub(x, 1, 3) <- "AAA"
x
```

### Collapse a vector

You can collapse a character vector of length `n > 1` to a single string with `str_c()`, which also has other uses (see the [next section](#catenate-vectors)).


```{r}
head(fruit) %>% 
  str_c(collapse = ", ")
```

### Create a character vector by catenating multiple vectors {#catenate-vectors}

If you have two or more character vectors of the same length, you can glue them together element-wise, to get a new vector of that length. Here are some ... awful smoothie flavors?

```{r}
str_c(fruit[1:4], fruit[5:8], sep = " & ")
```

Element-wise catenation can be combined with collapsing.

```{r}
str_c(fruit[1:4], fruit[5:8], sep = " & ", collapse = ", ")
```

If the to-be-combined vectors are variables in a data frame, you can use `tidyr::unite()` to make a single new variable from them.

```{r}
fruit_df <- tibble(
  fruit1 = fruit[1:4],
  fruit2 = fruit[5:8]
)
fruit_df %>% 
  unite("flavor_combo", fruit1, fruit2, sep = " & ")
```

### Substring replacement 

You can replace a pattern with `str_replace()`. Here we use an explicit string-to-replace, but later we revisit with a regular expression.

```{r}
str_replace(my_fruit, pattern = "fruit", replacement = "THINGY")
```

A special case that comes up a lot is replacing `NA`, for which there is `str_replace_na()`.

```{r}
melons <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "melon")
melons[2] <- NA
melons
str_replace_na(melons, "UNKNOWN MELON")
```

If the `NA`-afflicted variable lives in a data frame, you can use `tidyr::replace_na()`.

```{r}
tibble(melons) %>% 
  replace_na(replace = list(melons = "UNKNOWN MELON"))
```

And that concludes our treatment of regex-free manipulations of character data!

### Regular expressions with stringr

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "From [\\@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/774309983467016193)", out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/regexp.jpg")

```

The country names in the `gapminder` dataset are convenient for examples. Load it now and store the `r nlevels(gapminder::gapminder$country)` unique country names in the object `countries`.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
countries <- levels(gapminder$country)
```

### Characters with special meaning

Frequently your string tasks cannot be expressed in terms of a fixed string, but can be described in terms of a **pattern**. Regular expressions, aka "regexes", are the standard way to specify these patterns. In regexes, specific characters and constructs take on special meaning in order to match multiple strings.

The first metacharacter is the period `.`, which stands for any single character, except a newline (which by the way, is represented by `\n`). The regex `a.b` will match all countries that have an `a`, followed by any single character, followed by `b`. Yes, regexes are case sensitive, i.e. "Italy" does not match.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, pattern = "i.a")
```

Notice that `i.a` matches "ina", "ica", "ita", and more.

**Anchors** can be included to express where the expression must occur within the string. The `^` indicates the beginning of string and `$` indicates the end.

Note how the regex `i.a$` matches many fewer countries than `i.a` alone. Likewise, more elements of `my_fruit` match `d` than `^d`, which requires "d" at string start.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, pattern = "i.a$")
str_subset(my_fruit, pattern = "d")
str_subset(my_fruit, pattern = "^d")
```

The metacharacter `\b` indicates a **word boundary** and `\B` indicates NOT a word boundary. This is our first encounter with something called "escaping" and right now I just want you at accept that we need to prepend a second backslash to use these sequences in regexes in R. We'll come back to this tedious point later.

```{r}
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "melon")
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "\\bmelon")
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "\\Bmelon")
```

### Character classes

Characters can be specified via classes. You can make them explicitly "by hand" or use some pre-existing ones.  Character classes are usually given inside square brackets, `[]` but a few come up so often that we have a metacharacter for them, such as `\d` for a single digit.

Here we match `ia` at the end of the country name, preceded by one of the characters in the class. Or, in the negated class, preceded by anything but one of those characters.

```{r}
# Make a class "by hand"

str_subset(countries, pattern = "[nls]ia$")

# Use ^ to negate the class

str_subset(countries, pattern = "[^nls]ia$")
```

Here we revisit splitting `my_fruit` with two more general ways to match whitespace: the `\s` metacharacter and the POSIX class `[:space:]`. Notice that we must prepend an extra backslash `\` to escape `\s` and the POSIX class has to be surrounded by two sets of square brackets.

```{r}
# Remember this?
# str_split_fixed(fruit, pattern = " ", n = 2)
# Alternatives:

str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = "\\s", n = 2)
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = "[[:space:]]", n = 2)
```

Let's see the country names that contain punctuation.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, "[[:punct:]]")
```

### Quantifiers

You can decorate characters (and other constructs, like metacharacters and classes) with information about how many characters they are allowed to match.

| quantifier | meaning   | quantifier | meaning                    |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------|
| *          | 0 or more | {n}        | exactly n                  |
| +          | 1 or more | {n,}       | at least n                 |
| ?          | 0 or 1    | {,m}       | at most m                  |
|            |           | {n,m}      | between n and m, inclusive |

Explore these by inspecting matches for `l` followed by `e`, allowing for various numbers of characters in between.

`l.*e` will match strings with 0 or more characters in between, i.e. any string with an `l` eventually followed by an `e`. This is the most inclusive regex for this example, so we store the result as `matches` to use as a baseline for comparison.

<!-- EF: Again the textbook is oscillating between multiple examples, which seems 
kind of unecessary. We should either pick the countries or the fruit to work with 
instead of incorporating both. Additionally, freeing up one of these datasets might 
make it easy to incorporate as like a regex madlib question on a problem set. --> 

```{r}
(matches <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.*e"))
```

Change the quantifier from `*` to `+` to require at least one intervening character. The strings that no longer match: all have a literal `le` with no preceding `l` and no following `e`.

```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.+e")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.+e")))
```

Change the quantifier from `*` to `?` to require at most one intervening character. In the strings that no longer match, the shortest gap between `l` and following `e` is at least two characters.

```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.?e")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.?e")))
```

Finally, we remove the quantifier and allow for no intervening characters. The strings that no longer match lack a literal `le`.

```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "le")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "le")))
```

### Escaping

You've probably caught on by now that there are certain characters with special meaning in regexes, including `$ * + . ? [ ] ^ { } | ( ) \`.

What if you really need the plus sign to be a literal plus sign and not a regex quantifier? You will need to *escape* it by prepending a backslash. But wait ... there's more! Before a regex is interpreted as a regular expression, it is also interpreted by R as a string. And backslash is used to escape there as well. So, in the end, you need to preprend two backslashes in order to match a literal plus sign in a regex.

This will be more clear with examples!

#### Escapes in plain old strings

Here is routine, non-regex use of backslash `\` escapes in plain vanilla R strings. We intentionally use `cat()` instead of `print()` here.

* To escape quotes inside quotes:
    ```{r}
    cat("Do you use \"airquotes\" much?")
    ```
    Sidebar: eliminating the need for these escapes is exactly why people use double quotes inside single quotes and *vice versa*.    
    
* To insert newline (`\n`) or tab (`\t`):
    ```{r}
    cat("before the newline\nafter the newline")
    cat("before the tab\tafter the tab")
    ```

#### Escapes in regular expressions

Examples of using escapes in regexes to match characters that would otherwise have a special interpretation.

We know several `gapminder` country names contain a period. How do we isolate them? Although it's tempting, this command `str_subset(countries, pattern = ".")` won't work!

```{r}
# Cheating using a POSIX class ;)

str_subset(countries, pattern = "[[:punct:]]")

# Using two backslashes to escape the period

str_subset(countries, pattern = "\\.")
```

A last example that matches an actual square bracket.

```{r end_char_vectors}
(x <- c("whatever", "X is distributed U[0,1]"))
str_subset(x, pattern = "\\[")
```

### Groups and backreferences

Your first use of regex is likely to be simple matching: detecting or isolating strings that match a pattern.

But soon you will want to use regexes to transform the strings in character vectors. That means you need a way to address specific parts of the matching strings and to operate on them.

You can use parentheses inside regexes to define *groups* and you can refer to those groups later with *backreferences*.

For now, this lesson will refer you to other place to read up on this:

* STAT 545 [2014 Intro to regular expressions](#oldies) by TA Gloria Li
* The [Strings chapter][r4ds-strings] of [R for Data Science][r4ds] [@wickham2016].

## Combining Data

There are many ways to bring data together.

__Bind__ - This is basically smashing ~~rocks~~ tibbles together. You can smash things together row-wise ("row binding") or column-wise ("column binding"). Why do I characterize this as rock-smashing? They're often fairly crude operations, with lots of responsibility falling on the analyst for making sure that the whole enterprise even makes sense.

When row binding, you need to consider the variables in the two tibbles. Do the same variables exist in each? Are they of the same type? Different approaches for row binding have different combinations of flexibility vs rigidity around these matters.

When column binding, the onus is entirely on the analyst to make sure that the rows are aligned. I would avoid column binding whenever possible. If you can introduce new variables through any other, safer means, do so! By safer, I mean: use a mechanism where the row alignment is correct **by definition**. A proper join is the gold standard. In addition to joins, functions like `dplyr::mutate()` and `tidyr::separate()` can be very useful for forcing yourself to work inside the constraint of a tibble.

__Join__ - Here you designate a variable (or a combination of variables) as a **key**. A row in one data frame gets matched with a row in another data frame because they have the same key. You can then bring information from variables in a secondary data frame into a primary data frame based on this key-based lookup. That description is incredibly oversimplified, but that's the basic idea.

A variety of row- and column-wise operations fit into this framework, which implies there are many different flavors of join. The concepts and vocabulary around joins come from the database world. The relevant functions in dplyr follow this convention and all mention `join`. The most relevant base R function is `merge()`.

Let's explore each type of operation with a few examples.

## Bind

### Row binding

We used word count data from the Lord of the Rings trilogy to explore the concept of tidy data. That kicked off with a quiet, successful row bind. Let's revisit that.

Here's what a perfect row bind of three (untidy!) data frames looks like.

```{r}
fship <- tribble(
                         ~Film,    ~Race, ~Female, ~Male,
  "The Fellowship Of The Ring",    "Elf",    1229,   971,
  "The Fellowship Of The Ring", "Hobbit",      14,  3644,
  "The Fellowship Of The Ring",    "Man",       0,  1995
)
rking <- tribble(
                         ~Film,    ~Race, ~Female, ~Male,
      "The Return Of The King",    "Elf",     183,   510,
      "The Return Of The King", "Hobbit",       2,  2673,
      "The Return Of The King",    "Man",     268,  2459
)
ttow <- tribble(
                         ~Film,    ~Race, ~Female, ~Male,
              "The Two Towers",    "Elf",     331,   513,
              "The Two Towers", "Hobbit",       0,  2463,
              "The Two Towers",    "Man",     401,  3589
)
(lotr_untidy <- bind_rows(fship, ttow, rking))
```

`dplyr::bind_rows()` works like a charm with these very row-bindable data frames! So does base `rbind()` (try it!).

But what if one of the data frames is somehow missing a variable? Let's mangle one and find out.

```{r error = TRUE}
ttow_no_Female <- ttow %>% mutate(Female = NULL)
bind_rows(fship, ttow_no_Female, rking)
rbind(fship, ttow_no_Female, rking)
```

We see that `dplyr::bind_rows()` does the row bind and puts `NA` in for the missing values caused by the lack of `Female` data from The Two Towers. Base `rbind()` refuses to row bind in this situation.

I invite you to experiment with other realistic, challenging scenarios, e.g.:

* Change the order of variables. Does row binding match variables by name or position?
* Row bind data frames where the variable `x` is of one type in one data frame and another type in the other. Try combinations that you think should work and some that should not. What actually happens?
* Row bind data frames in which the factor `x` has different levels in one data frame and different levels in the other. What happens?

In conclusion, row binding usually works when it should (especially with `dplyr::bind_rows()`) and usually doesn't when it shouldn't. The biggest risk is being aggravated.

#### Column binding

Column binding is much more dangerous because it often "works" when it should not. It's **your job** to make sure the rows are aligned and it's all too easy to screw this up.

The data in `gapminder` was originally excavated from 3 messy Excel spreadsheets: one each for life expectancy, population, and GDP per capital. Let's relive some of the data wrangling joy and show a column bind gone wrong.

I create 3 separate data frames, do some evil row sorting, then column bind. There are no errors. The result `gapminder_garbage` sort of looks OK. Univariate summary statistics and exploratory plots will look OK. But I've created complete nonsense!

```{r}
library(gapminder)

life_exp <- gapminder %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp)

pop <- gapminder %>%
  arrange(year) %>% 
  select(pop)
  
gdp_percap <- gapminder %>% 
  arrange(pop) %>% 
  select(gdpPercap)

(gapminder_garbage <- bind_cols(life_exp, pop, gdp_percap))

summary(gapminder$lifeExp)
summary(gapminder_garbage$lifeExp)
range(gapminder$gdpPercap)
range(gapminder_garbage$gdpPercap)
```

One last cautionary tale about column binding. This one requires the use of `cbind()` and it's why the tidyverse is generally unwilling to recycle when combining things of different length.

I create a tibble with most of the `gapminder` columns. I create another with the remainder, but filtered down to just one country. I am able to `cbind()` these objects! Why? Because the 12 rows for Canada divide evenly into the 1704 rows of `gapminder`. Note that `dplyr::bind_cols()` refuses to column bind here.

```{r}
gapminder_mostly <- gapminder %>% select(-pop, -gdpPercap)
gapminder_leftovers_filtered <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada") %>% 
  select(pop, gdpPercap)

gapminder_nonsense <- cbind(gapminder_mostly, gapminder_leftovers_filtered)
head(gapminder_nonsense, 14)
```

This data frame isn't obviously wrong, but it is wrong. See how the Canada's population and GDP per capita repeat for each country?

Bottom line: Row bind when you need to, but inspect the results re: coercion. Column bind only if you must and be extremely paranoid.

### Joins in dplyr
The most recent release of gapminder includes a new data frame, `country_codes`, with country names and ISO codes. Therefore you can also use it to practice joins.

```{r end_multi_tibbles}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, continent) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  left_join(country_codes)
```

### Joining

Join (a.k.a. merge) two tables: dplyr join cheatsheet with comic characters and publishers.

```{r gt-table-making-functions, include = FALSE}
library(gt)

# function to style the tables for display
# used alongside CSS
style_table <- function(data, table_title) {
  data %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = table_title
  ) %>% 
  tab_options(
    table.align = "left",
    table.font.size = pct(80),
    heading.title.font.size = pct(90),
    column_labels.font.size = pct(90),
    table.width = "100%",
    row.striping.include_table_body = TRUE
  )
}

get_col_widths <- function(super_first = TRUE) {
  if (super_first == TRUE) {
    col_left <- 38; col_mid <- 18; col_right <- (100 - col_left - col_mid)
  } else {
    col_left <- 18; col_mid <- 38; col_right <- (100 - col_left - col_mid)
  }
  gt_col_widths <- list(col_left_width = col_left, 
                        col_mid_width = col_mid, 
                        col_right_width = col_right)
  return(gt_col_widths)
}
  
make_three_gt <- function(gt_left, gt_mid, gt_right, ...) {
  gt_col_widths <- get_col_widths(...)
  htmltools::withTags(
  table(style = "width: 100%; border: 0px;",
    tr(
      td(style = glue::glue("width: {gt_col_widths[[1]]}%; vertical-align: top;"),
        gt:::as.tags.gt_tbl(gt_left)
      ),
      td(style = glue::glue("width: {gt_col_widths[[2]]}%; vertical-align: top;"),
        gt:::as.tags.gt_tbl(gt_mid)
      ),
      td(style = glue::glue("width: {gt_col_widths[[3]]}%; vertical-align: top;"),
        gt:::as.tags.gt_tbl(gt_right)
      )
    )
  )
)
}
```

#### The data

Working with two small data frames: `superheroes` and `publishers`.

```{r start_joins, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# dplyr provides the join functions

library(tidyverse)

superheroes <- tibble::tribble(
       ~name, ~alignment,  ~gender,          ~publisher,
   "Magneto",      "bad",   "male",            "Marvel",
     "Storm",     "good", "female",            "Marvel",
  "Mystique",      "bad", "female",            "Marvel",
    "Batman",     "good",   "male",                "DC",
     "Joker",      "bad",   "male",                "DC",
  "Catwoman",      "bad", "female",                "DC",
   "Hellboy",     "good",   "male", "Dark Horse Comics"
  )

publishers <- tibble::tribble(
  ~publisher, ~yr_founded,
        "DC",       1934L,
    "Marvel",       1939L,
     "Image",       1992L
  )
```

Sorry, cheat sheet does not illustrate "multiple match" situations terribly well.

Sub-plot: watch the row and variable order of the join results for a healthy reminder of why it's dangerous to rely on any of that in an analysis.

```{r style-gt-tables, include = FALSE}
# superheroes will always be lilac
super_gt <- style_table(superheroes, "superheroes") %>% 
  tab_options(
    table.background.color = "#edc7fc" # lilac
  )

# publishers will always be light blue
pub_gt <- style_table(publishers, "publishers") %>% 
  tab_options(
    table.background.color = "#cce6f6" # light blue
  )
```

#### `inner_join(superheroes, publishers)`

> `inner_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`. If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combination of the matches are returned. This is a mutating join.

```{r}
(ijsp <- inner_join(superheroes, publishers))
```

We lose Hellboy in the join because, although he appears in `x = superheroes`, his publisher Dark Horse Comics does not appear in `y = publishers`. The join result has all variables from `x = superheroes` plus `yr_founded`, from `y`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ijsp_gt <- style_table(ijsp, "inner_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(super_gt, pub_gt, ijsp_gt)
```



#### `semi_join(superheroes, publishers)`

> `semi_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`. A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of `x` for each matching row of `y`, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of `x`. This is a filtering join.

```{r}
(sjsp <- semi_join(superheroes, publishers))
```

We get a similar result as with `inner_join()` but the join result contains only the variables originally found in `x = superheroes`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
sjsp_gt <- style_table(sjsp, "semi_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(super_gt, pub_gt, sjsp_gt)
```


#### `left_join(superheroes, publishers)`

> `left_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x`, and all columns from `x` and `y`. If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combination of the matches are returned. This is a mutating join.

```{r}
(ljsp <- left_join(superheroes, publishers))
```

We basically get `x = superheroes` back, but with the addition of variable `yr_founded`, which is unique to `y = publishers`. Hellboy, whose publisher does not appear in `y = publishers`, has an `NA` for `yr_founded`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ljsp_gt <- style_table(ljsp, "left_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(super_gt, pub_gt, ljsp_gt)
```


#### `anti_join(superheroes, publishers)`

> `anti_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x` where there are not matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`. This is a filtering join.

```{r}
(ajsp <- anti_join(superheroes, publishers))
```

We keep __only__ Hellboy now (and do not get `yr_founded`).

```{r echo = FALSE}
ajsp_gt <- style_table(ajsp, "anti_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(super_gt, pub_gt, ajsp_gt)
```


#### `inner_join(publishers, superheroes)`

> `inner_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`. If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combination of the matches are returned. This is a mutating join.

```{r}
(ijps <- inner_join(publishers, superheroes))
```

In a way, this does illustrate multiple matches, if you think about it from the `x = publishers` direction. Every publisher that has a match in `y = superheroes` appears multiple times in the result, once for each match. In fact, we're getting the same result as with `inner_join(superheroes, publishers)`, up to variable order (which you should also never rely on in an analysis).

```{r echo = FALSE}
ijps_gt <- style_table(ijps, "inner_join(x = publishers, y = superheroes)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(pub_gt, super_gt, ijps_gt, super_first = FALSE)
```


<!-- EF: Maybe instead of reiterating the types of joins each time, a section for 
both directions of each join would be a little less disjoint. Here, the definition
of each join is repeated twice, which seems unnecessary and could lead to confusion -->

#### `semi_join(publishers, superheroes)`

> `semi_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`. A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of `x` for each matching row of `y`, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of `x`. This is a filtering join.

```{r}
(sjps <- semi_join(x = publishers, y = superheroes))
```

Now the effects of switching the `x` and `y` roles is more clear. The result resembles `x = publishers`, but the publisher Image is lost, because there are no observations where `publisher == "Image"` in `y = superheroes`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
sjps_gt <- style_table(sjps, "semi_join(x = publishers, y = superheroes)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(pub_gt, super_gt, sjps_gt, super_first = FALSE)
```


#### `left_join(publishers, superheroes)`

> `left_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x`, and all columns from `x` and `y`. If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combination of the matches are returned. This is a mutating join.

```{r}
(ljps <- left_join(publishers, superheroes))
```

We get a similar result as with `inner_join()` but the publisher Image survives in the join, even though no superheroes from Image appear in `y = superheroes`. As a result, Image has `NA`s for `name`, `alignment`, and `gender`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ljps_gt <- style_table(ljps, "left_join(x = publishers, y = superheroes)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(pub_gt, super_gt, ljps_gt, super_first = FALSE)
```

#### `anti_join(publishers, superheroes)`

> `anti_join(x, y)`: Return all rows from `x` where there are not matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`. This is a filtering join.

```{r}
(ajps <- anti_join(publishers, superheroes))
```

We keep __only__ publisher Image now (and the variables found in `x = publishers`).

```{r echo = FALSE}
ajps_gt <- style_table(ajps, "anti_join(x = publishers, y = superheroes)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(pub_gt, super_gt, ajps_gt, super_first = FALSE)
```

#### `full_join(superheroes, publishers)`

> `full_join(x, y)`: Return all rows and all columns from both `x` and `y`. Where there are not matching values, returns `NA` for the one missing. This is a mutating join.

```{r}
(fjsp <- full_join(superheroes, publishers))
```

We get all rows of `x = superheroes` plus a new row from `y = publishers`, containing the publisher Image. We get all variables from `x = superheroes` AND all variables from `y = publishers`. Any row that derives solely from one table or the other carries `NA`s in the variables found only in the other table.

```{r echo = FALSE}
fjsp_gt <- style_table(fjsp, "full_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers)") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
make_three_gt(super_gt, pub_gt, fjsp_gt)
```


#### `join` data frames {#joins}

"Joining" or "merging" two different datasets is tricky stuff. Let's go through some more examples while reviewing the basic concepts. In the `flights` data frame, the variable `carrier` lists the carrier code for the different flights. While the corresponding airline names for `"UA"` and `"AA"` might be somewhat easy to guess (United and American Airlines), what airlines have codes `"VX"`, `"HA"`, and `"B6"`? This information is provided in a separate data frame `airlines`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(airlines)
```

We see that in `airports`, `carrier` is the carrier code, while `name` is the full name of the airline company. Using this table, we can see that `"VX"`, `"HA"`, and `"B6"` correspond to Virgin America, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue, respectively. However, wouldn't it be nice to have all this information in a single data frame instead of two separate data frames? We can do this by "joining" the `flights` and `airlines` data frames.

Note that the values in the variable `carrier` in the `flights` data frame match the values in the variable `carrier` in the `airlines` data frame. In this case, we can use the variable `carrier` as a *key variable* to match the rows of the two data frames. Key variables are almost always *identification variables* that uniquely identify the observational units. This ensures that rows in both data frames are appropriately matched during the join. Hadley and Garrett [@rds2016] created the following diagram to help us understand how the different data frames in the `nycflights13` package are linked by various key variables:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationships among nycflights tables"}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/relational-nycflights.png")
```

### Matching "key" variable names

In both the `flights` and `airlines` data frames, the key variable we want to join/merge/match the rows by has the same name: `carrier`. Let's use the `inner_join()`  function to join the two data frames, where the rows will be matched by the variable `carrier`, and then compare the resulting data frames:

```{r eval=FALSE}
flights_joined <- flights %>% 
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
View(flights)
View(flights_joined)
```

Observe that the `flights` and `flights_joined` data frames are identical except that `flights_joined` has an additional variable `name`. The values of `name` correspond to the airline companies' names as indicated in the `airlines` data frame. 

<!-- EF: This seems somewhat out of place (just these few lines below) since the
joins are described in the section above with the superhero examples. Additionally,
within the superhero examples there was no mention of right_join() or outer_join. -->

A visual representation of the `inner_join()` is shown in the figure below [@rds2016]. There are other types of joins available (such as `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `outer_join()`, and `anti_join()`), but the `inner_join()` will solve nearly all of the problems you'll encounter in this book.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Inner join."}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/join-inner.png")
```



### Different "key" variable names {#diff-key}

Say instead you are interested in the destinations of all domestic flights departing NYC in 2013, and you ask yourself questions like: "What cities are these airports in?", or "Is `"ORD"` Orlando?", or "Where is `"FLL"`?".

The `airports` data frame contains the airport codes for each airport:

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(airports)
```

However, if you look at both the `airports` and `flights` data frames, you'll find that the airport codes are in variables that have different names. In `airports` the airport code is in `faa`, whereas in `flights` the airport codes are in `origin` and `dest`. 

In order to join these two data frames by airport code, our `inner_join()` operation will use the `by = c("dest" = "faa")` argument with modified code syntax allowing us to join two data frames where the key variable has a different name:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights_with_airport_names <- flights %>% 
  inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
View(flights_with_airport_names)
```

Let's construct the chain of pipe operators `%>%` that computes the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also includes information about each destination airport:

```{r}
named_dests <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(num_flights = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_flights)) %>%
  inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  rename(airport_name = name)
named_dests
```

In case you didn't know, `"ORD"` is the airport code of Chicago O'Hare airport and `"FLL"` is the main airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which can be seen in the `airport_name` variable.

### Multiple "key" variables

Say instead we want to join two data frames by *multiple key variables*. For example, we see that in order to join the `flights` and `weather` data frames, we need more than one key variable: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin`. This is because the combination of these 5 variables act to uniquely identify each observational unit in the `weather` data frame: hourly weather recordings at each of the 3 NYC airports.

We achieve this by specifying a *vector* of key variables to join by using the `c()` function. Recall that `c()` is short for "combine" or "concatenate."

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights_weather_joined <- flights %>%
  inner_join(weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "hour", "origin"))
View(flights_weather_joined)
```

<!-- EF: it would probably be useful here to show what happens when you miss one
of there variables (or when you have variables in each dataset with the same name) --> 


### Normal forms {#normal-forms}

The data frames included in the `nycflights13` package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data. For example, the `flights` data frame only saves the `carrier` code of the airline company; it does not include the actual name of the airline. For example, the first row of `flights` has `carrier` equal to `UA`, but it does not include the airline name of "United Air Lines Inc." 

The names of the airline companies are included in the `name` variable of the `airlines` data frame. In order to have the airline company name included in `flights`, we could join these two data frames as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
joined_flights <- flights %>% 
  inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
View(joined_flights)
```

We are capable of performing this join because each of the data frames have _keys_ in common to relate one to another: the `carrier` variable in both the `flights` and `airlines` data frames.  The *key* variable(s) that we base our joins on are often *identification variables* as we mentioned previously. 

This is an important property of what's known as *normal forms* of data.  The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called *normalization*.  More information is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).

Both **dplyr** and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) we mentioned in the introduction of this chapter use such *normal forms*. Given that they share such commonalities, once you learn either of these two tools, you can learn the other very easily. 


## Tidy {#tidy}

Now, we will explore the topic of "tidy" data, a manner of data formatting particularly suited to the creation of graphics and the manipulation of the dataframe. You will see that having data stored in "tidy" format is about more than just what the everyday definition of the term "tidy" might suggest: having your data "neatly organized." Instead, we define the term "tidy" as it's used by data scientists who use R, outlining a set of rules by which data is saved.

Knowledge of this type of data formatting was not necessary for our treatment of data visualization in Chapter 1 and in previous data wrangling topics. This is because all the data used were already in "tidy" format. In this chapter, we'll now see that this format is essential to using the tools we covered up until now. Furthermore, it will also be useful for all subsequent chapters in this book when we cover regression and statistical inference. First, however, we'll show you how to import spreadsheet data in R.

Let's load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you've already installed them). 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Packages needed internally, but not in text.
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(stringr)
library(scales)
```

## "Tidy" data {#tidy-data-ex}

Let's now switch gears and learn about the concept of "tidy" data format with a motivating example from the `fivethirtyeight` package. The `fivethirtyeight` package [@R-fivethirtyeight] provides access to the datasets used in many articles published by the data journalism website, [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). For a complete list of all `r nrow(data(package = "fivethirtyeight")[[3]])` datasets included in the `fivethirtyeight` package, check out the package webpage by going to: <https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/articles/fivethirtyeight.html>.

Let's focus our attention on the `drinks` data frame and look at its first 5 rows:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
drinks %>%  
  head(5)
```

After reading the help file by running `?drinks`, you'll see that `drinks` is a data frame containing results from a survey of the average number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed in 193 countries. This data was originally reported on FiveThirtyEight.com in Mona Chalabi's article: ["Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/).

Let's apply some of the data wrangling verbs on the `drinks` data frame:

1. `filter()` the `drinks` data frame to only consider 4 countries: the United States, China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, *then*
1. `select()` all columns except `total_litres_of_pure_alcohol` by using the `-` sign, *then*
1. `rename()` the variables `beer_servings`, `spirit_servings`, and `wine_servings` to `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`, respectively.

and save the resulting data frame in `drinks_smaller`:

```{r}
drinks_smaller <- drinks %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("USA", "China", "Italy", "Saudi Arabia")) %>% 
  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) %>% 
  rename(beer = beer_servings, spirit = spirit_servings, wine = wine_servings)
drinks_smaller
```

Let's now ask ourselves a question: "Using the `drinks_smaller` data frame, how would we create the side-by-side barplot below. 

```{r, fig.cap="Comparing alcohol consumption in 4 countries.", fig.height=3.9, echo=FALSE}
drinks_smaller_tidy <- drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, names_to = "type", values_to = "servings")
drinks_smaller_tidy_plot <- ggplot(
    drinks_smaller_tidy, 
    aes(x = country, y = servings, fill = type)
    ) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "country", y = "servings")
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot
} else {
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot + scale_fill_grey()
}
```

Let's break down the grammar of graphic:

1. The categorical variable `country` with four levels (China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, USA) would have to be mapped to the `x`-position of the bars.
1. The numerical variable `servings` would have to be mapped to the `y`-position of the bars (the height of the bars).
1. The categorical variable `type` with three levels (beer, spirit, wine) would have to be mapped to the `fill` color of the bars.

Observe, however, that `drinks_smaller` has three separate variables `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`. In order to use the `ggplot()` function to recreate the barplot we need a *single variable* `type` with three possible values: `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`.  We could then map this `type` variable to the `fill` aesthetic of our plot.  In other words, to recreate the barplot, our data frame would have to look like this:

```{r}
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

Observe that while `drinks_smaller` and `drinks_smaller_tidy` are both rectangular in shape and contain the same 12 numerical values (3 alcohol types by 4 countries), they are formatted differently. `drinks_smaller` is formatted in what's known as  ["wide"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) format, whereas `drinks_smaller_tidy` is formatted in what's known as ["long/narrow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data#Narrow) format.

In the context of doing data science in R, long/narrow format is also known as "tidy" format. In order to use the **ggplot2** and **dplyr** packages for data visualization and data wrangling, your input data frames *must* be in "tidy" format. Thus, all non-"tidy" data must be converted to "tidy" format first. Before we convert non-"tidy" data frames like `drinks_smaller` to "tidy" data frames like `drinks_smaller_tidy`, let's define "tidy" data.

### Definition of "tidy" data {#tidy-definition}

You have surely heard the word "tidy" in your life:

* "Tidy up your room!"
* "Write your homework in a tidy way so it is easier to provide feedback."
* Marie Kondo's best-selling book, [_The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing_](https://www.powells.com/book/-9781607747307), and Netflix TV series [_Tidying Up with Marie Kondo_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80209379).
* "I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - 'Read me, please!'" - Linda Grant

What does it mean for your data to be "tidy"? While "tidy" has a clear English meaning of "organized," the word "tidy" in data science using R means that your data follows a standardized format. We will follow Hadley Wickham's  definition of *"tidy" data*  [@tidy]:

> A *dataset* is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings AKA text data (if qualitative/categorical). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes.
> 
> "Tidy" data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In *tidy data*:
>
> 1. Each variable forms a column.
> 2. Each observation forms a row.
> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

(ref:tidy-r4ds) Tidy data graphic from *R for Data Science*.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/tidy-1.png")
```


### Converting to "tidy" data

In this book so far, you've only seen data frames that were already in "tidy" format. Furthermore, for the rest of this book, you'll mostly only see data frames that are already in "tidy" format as well. This is not always the case however with all datasets in the world. If your original data frame is in wide (non-"tidy") format and you would like to use the **ggplot2** or **dplyr** packages, you will first have to convert it to "tidy" format. To do so, we recommend using the `pivot_longer()` function in the **tidyr** package [@R-tidyr]. 

Going back to our `drinks_smaller` data frame from earlier:

```{r}
drinks_smaller
```

We convert it to "tidy" format by using the `pivot_longer()` function from the **tidyr** package as follows:

```{r}
drinks_smaller_tidy <- drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = -country)
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

We set the arguments to `pivot_longer()` as follows:

1. `names_to` here corresponds to the name of the variable in the new "tidy"/long data frame that will contain the *column names* of the original data. Observe how we set `names_to = "type"`. In the resulting `drinks_smaller_tidy`, the column `type` contains the three types of alcohol `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`. Since `type` is a variable name that doesn't appear in `drinks_smaller`, we use quotation marks around it. You'll receive an error if you just use `names_to = type` here.
1. `values_to` here is the name of the variable in the new "tidy" data frame that will contain the *values* of the original data. Observe how we set `values_to = "servings"` since each of the numeric values in each of the `beer`, `wine`, and `spirit` columns of the `drinks_smaller` data corresponds to a value of `servings`. In the resulting `drinks_smaller_tidy`, the column `servings` contains the 4 $\times$ 3 = 12 numerical values. Note again that `servings` doesn't appear as a variable in `drinks_smaller` so it again needs quotation marks around it for the `values_to` argument.
1. The third argument `cols` is the columns in the `drinks_smaller` data frame you either want to or don't want to "tidy." Observe how we set this to `-country` indicating that we don't want to "tidy" the `country` variable in `drinks_smaller` and rather only `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`. Since `country` is a column that appears in `drinks_smaller` we don't put quotation marks around it.

The third argument here of `cols` is a little nuanced, so let's consider code that's written slightly differently but that produces the same output: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = c(beer, spirit, wine))
```

Note that the third argument now specifies which columns we want to "tidy" with `c(beer, spirit, wine)`, instead of the columns we don't want to "tidy" using `-country`. We use the `c()` function to create a vector of the columns in `drinks_smaller` that we'd like to "tidy." Note that since these three columns appear one after another in the `drinks_smaller` data frame, we could also do the following for the `cols` argument:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = beer:wine)
```

With our `drinks_smaller_tidy` "tidy" formatted data frame, we can now produce the barplot you saw previously using `geom_col()`. Recall from the previous chapter that we use `geom_col()` and not `geom_bar()`, since we would like to map the "pre-counted" `servings` variable to the `y`-aesthetic of the bars.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(drinks_smaller_tidy, aes(x = country, y = servings, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

(ref:drinks-col) Comparing alcohol consumption in 4 countries using geom_col().

```{r drinks-smaller-tidy-barplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:drinks-col)', fig.height=2.5}
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot
} else {
  drinks_smaller_tidy_plot + scale_fill_grey()
}
```

Converting "wide" format data to "tidy" format often confuses new R users. The only way to learn to get comfortable with the `pivot_longer()` function is with practice, practice, and more practice using different datasets. For example, run `?pivot_longer` and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file.

If however you want to convert a "tidy" data frame to "wide" format, you will need to use the `pivot_wider()` function instead. Run `?pivot_wider` and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file for examples.

You can also view examples of both `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` on the [tidyverse.org](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html#pew) webpage. There's a nice example to check out the different functions available for data tidying and a case study using data from the World Health Organization on that webpage. Furthermore, each week the R4DS Online Learning Community posts a dataset in the weekly [`#`TidyTuesday event](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) that might serve as a nice place for you to find other data to explore and transform. 

## `tidyverse` package {#tidyverse-package}

Notice at the beginning of the chapter we loaded the following four packages, which are among four of the most frequently used R packages for data science:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```

Recall that **ggplot2** is for data visualization, **dplyr** is for data wrangling, **readr** is for importing spreadsheet data into R, and **tidyr** is for converting data to "tidy" format. There is a much quicker way to load these packages than by individually loading them: by installing and loading the `tidyverse` package. The `tidyverse` package acts as an "umbrella" package whereby installing/loading it will install/load multiple packages at once for you. 

Running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

would be the same as running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
```

The `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats` are left for a more advanced book; check out [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) to learn about these packages.

For the remainder of this book, we'll start every chapter by running `library(tidyverse)`, instead of loading the various component packages individually. The `tidyverse` "umbrella" package gets its name from the fact that all the functions in all its packages are designed to have common inputs and outputs: data frames are in "tidy" format. This standardization of input and output data frames makes transitions between different functions in the different packages as seamless as possible. For more information, check out the [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/) webpage for the package.

## Web scraping 

<!-- https://github.com/mdogucu/web-scrape -->

The data we need to answer a question is not always in a spreadsheet ready for us to read. For example, the US murders dataset we used in the R Basics chapter originally comes from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state): 

```{r}
url <- paste0("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=",
              "Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state",
              "&direction=prev&oldid=810166167")
```

You can see the data table when you visit the webpage:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/murders-data-wiki-page.png")
```


To get this data, we need to do some _web scraping_. 

_Web scraping_, or _web harvesting_, is the term we use to describe the process of extracting data from a website. The reason we can do this is because the information used by a browser to render webpages is received as a text file from a server. The text is code written in hyper text markup language (HTML). Every browser has a way to show the html source code for a page, each one different. On Chrome, you can use Control-U on a PC and command+alt+U on a Mac. You will see something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/html-code.png")
```

### HTML

Because this code is accessible, we can download the HTML file, import it into R, and then write programs to extract the information we need from the page. However, once we look at HTML code, this might seem like a daunting task. But we will show you some convenient tools to facilitate the process. To get an idea of how it works, here are a few lines of code from the Wikipedia page that provides the US murders data:

```
<table class="wikitable sortable">
<tr>
<th>State</th>
<th><a href="/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population" 
title="List of U.S. states and territories by population">Population</a><br />
<small>(total inhabitants)</small><br />
<small>(2015)</small> <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">
<a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></th>
<th>Murders and Nonnegligent
<p>Manslaughter<br />
<small>(total deaths)</small><br />
<small>(2015)</small> <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">
<a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
</th>
<th>Murder and Nonnegligent
<p>Manslaughter Rate<br />
<small>(per 100,000 inhabitants)</small><br />
<small>(2015)</small></p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a></td>
<td>4,853,875</td>
<td>348</td>
<td>7.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a></td>
<td>737,709</td>
<td>59</td>
<td>8.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
```

You can actually see the data, except data values are surrounded by html code such as `<td>`. We can also see a pattern of how it is stored. If you know HTML, you can write programs that leverage knowledge of these patterns to extract what we want. We also take advantage of a language widely used to make webpages look "pretty" called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

Although we provide tools that make it possible to scrape data without knowing HTML, as a data scientist it is quite useful to learn some HTML and CSS. Not only does this improve your scraping skills, but it might come in handy if you are creating a webpage to showcase your work. 

### The rvest package

The __tidyverse__ provides a web harvesting package called __rvest__. The first step using this package is to import the webpage into R. The package makes this quite simple:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
h <- read_html(url)
```


Note that the entire Murders in the US Wikipedia webpage is now contained in `h`. The class of this object is:

```{r}
class(h)
```

The __rvest__ package is actually more general; it handles XML documents. XML is a general markup language (that's what the ML stands for) that can be used to represent any kind of data. HTML is a specific type of XML specifically developed for representing webpages. Here we focus on HTML documents.

Now, how do we extract the table from the object `h`? If we print `h`, we don't really see much:

```{r}
h
```

We can see all the code that defines the downloaded webpage using the `html_text` function like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
html_text(h)
```

We don't show the output here because it includes thousands of characters, but if we look at it, we can see the data we are after are stored in an HTML table: you can see this in this line of the HTML code above `<table class="wikitable sortable">`. The different parts of an HTML document, often defined with a message in between  `<` and `>`  are referred to as _nodes_. The __rvest__ package includes functions to extract nodes of an HTML document: `html_nodes` extracts all nodes of different types and `html_node` extracts the first one. To extract the tables from the html code we use:

```{r} 
tab <- h %>% html_nodes("table")
```

Now, instead of the entire webpage, we just have the html code for the tables in the page:

```{r}
tab
```

The table we are interested is the first one:

```{r}
tab[[1]]
```


This is clearly not a tidy dataset, not even a data frame. In the code above, you can definitely see a pattern and writing code to extract just the data is very doable. In fact, __rvest__ includes a function just for converting HTML tables into data frames:


```{r}
tab <- tab[[1]] %>% html_table
class(tab)
```

We are now much closer to having a usable data table:

```{r}
tab <- tab %>% setNames(c("state", "population", "total", "murder_rate")) 
head(tab)
```

<!-- EF: I think taking this detour below might not actually be the best move. 
The sections on CSS Selectors and JSON might work better more as an afterthought --> 

We still have some wrangling to do. For example, we need to remove the commas and turn characters into numbers. Before continuing with this, we will learn a more general approach to extracting information from web sites.


### CSS selectors {#css-selectors}

The default look of a webpage made with the most basic HTML is quite unattractive. The aesthetically pleasing pages we see today are made using CSS to define the look and style of webpages. The fact that all pages for a company have the same style usually results from their use of the same CSS file to define the style. The general way these CSS files work is by defining how each of the elements of a webpage will look. The title, headings, itemized lists, tables, and links, for example, each receive their own style including font, color, size, and distance from the margin. CSS does this by leveraging patterns used to define these elements, referred to as _selectors_. An example of such a pattern, which we used above, is `table`, but there are many, many more. 

If we want to grab data from a webpage and we happen to know a selector that is unique to the part of the page containing this data, we can use the `html_nodes` function. However, knowing which selector can be quite complicated. 
In fact, the complexity of webpages has been increasing as they become more sophisticated. For some of the more advanced ones, it seems almost impossible to find the nodes that define a particular piece of data. However, selector gadgets actually make this possible.

SelectorGadget^[http://selectorgadget.com/] is piece of software that allows you to interactively determine what CSS selector you need to extract specific components from the webpage. If you plan on scraping data other than tables from html pages, we highly recommend you install it. A Chrome extension is available which permits you to turn on the gadget and then, as you click through the page, it highlights parts and shows you the selector you need to extract these parts. There are various demos of how to do this including __rvest__ author Hadley Wickham's
vignette^[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html] and other tutorials based on the vignette^[https://stat4701.github.io/edav/2015/04/02/rvest_tutorial/] ^[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginners-guide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/].

### JSON

Sharing data on the internet has become more and more common. Unfortunately, providers use different formats, which makes it harder for data scientists to wrangle data into R. Yet there are some standards that are also becoming more common. Currently, a format that is widely being adopted is the JavaScript Object Notation or JSON. Because this format is very general, it is nothing like a spreadsheet. This JSON file looks more like the code you use to define a list. Here is an example of information stored in a JSON format:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
example <- data.frame(name= c("Miguel", "Sofia", "Aya", "Cheng"), student_id = 1:4, exam_1 = c(85, 94, 87, 90), exam_2 = c(86, 93, 88, 91))
json <- toJSON(example, pretty = TRUE) 
json
```

The file above actually represents a data frame. To read it, we can use the function `fromJSON` from the __jsonlite__ package. Note that JSON files are often made available via the internet. Several organizations provide a JSON API or a web service that you can connect directly to and obtain data. Here is an example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
citi_bike <- fromJSON("http://citibikenyc.com/stations/json")
```

This downloads a list. The first argument tells you when you downloaded it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
citi_bike$executionTime
```

and the second is a data table:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
citi_bike$stationBeanList %>% as_tibble() 
```


You can learn much more by examining tutorials and help files from the __jsonlite__ package. This package is intended for relatively simple tasks such as converging data into tables. For more flexibility, we recommend `rjson`.


## Conclusion

### Additional resources

If you want to learn more about using the **readr** and **tidyr** package, we suggest that you check out RStudio's "Data Import Cheat Sheet." In the current version of RStudio in late 2019, you can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -> Help -> Cheatsheets -> "Browse Cheatsheets" -> Scroll down the page to the "Data Import Cheat Sheet." The first page of this cheatsheet has information on using the **readr** package to import data, while the second page has information on using the **tidyr** package to "tidy" data. `r if(knitr::is_html_output()) "You can see a preview of both cheatsheets in the figures below."`

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Data Import cheatsheet (first page): readr package."}
knitr::include_graphics("02-tidyverse/images/data-import-1.png")

```


#### Generating data using statistical distributions

<!-- EC: Is using this moderndive paragraph enough background for distributions?-->

What is a distribution? The distribution of a variable shows how frequently different values of a variable occur. Looking at the visualization of a distribution can show where the values are centered, show how the values vary, and give some information about where a typical value might fall. It can also alert you to the presence of outliers. If you feel like we have encountered distributions before, then you are absolutely correct. Recall that we can visualize the distribution of a numerical variable using binning in a histogram and that we can visualize the distribution of a categorical variable using a barplot.

<!-- EC: What formulas do we want? I'm guessing not something as complex as a probability density function, will explaining the elements of a normal/Uniform dist be enough? -->

The function `rnorm()` can be read of "r-norm". It corresponds to a Normal distribution, whose histograms look roughly like the following:

<!-- EC: Clean up graphic (or even just insert as picture?) -->

```{r echo=FALSE}
rnorm(1000) %>% hist()
```

`rnorm()` has three arguments: `n`, `mean`, and `sd`. `n` corresponds to the number of observations, `mean` corresponds to the average as a whole, and `sd` corresponds to the size of the standard deviation from the mean. We will go further in depth in future chapters on what the statistical mechanics are behind these distributions, but for now, let's focus on creating a Normal distribution.

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
Insert Normal formula here.
```

If we run the following:
```{r}
rnorm(10)
```

We get 10 observations centered around a default `mean` of 0 with a default `sd` of 1. What if we create a histogram of the values?

```{r}
rnorm(10) %>% hist()
```
As you can see, it's not as symmetrical as the one displayed before. Now what if we try taking 100 observations, then 1000?

```{r}
rnorm(100) %>% hist()
```

```{r}
rnorm(1000) %>% hist()
```

Now it's looking a lot more similar! As you just discovered, the more observations a normal distribution has, the closer it looks to a symmetrical bell curve.

The function `runif()` can be read as "r-unif". It corresponds to a Uniform distribution, in which every outcome has the same chance of occurring. A Uniform distribution you might encounter everyday is rolling a fair die. You are as likely to roll a 2 as you are to roll a 6.

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
Insert uniform formula here.
```

The `runif()` function allows us to create our own uniform distributions with the specifications `n`, `min`, and `max`. Note that in R, `runif()` returns a continuous uniform distribution, not a discrete one. This means that if we tried to simulate our die-rolling example, we would get decimal values.

Let's press on with our die-rolling example now that we have cautioned you about the difference between discrete and continuous uniform distributions. There are three arguments to `runif()`: `n`, `min`, and `max`. `n` is the number of observations, or `n = 1` since we are rolling the die once. The default value for `min` is `0` and the default value of `max` is 1. In our die-rolling example, these two values would be `min = 1` and `max = 6`, respectively. Let's plug these arguments into the function and see what we get.

```{r}
runif(1,1,6)
```
Nice! We just made our first uniform distribution. Again, note that the output contains decimel numbers.
